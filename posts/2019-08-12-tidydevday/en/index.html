<p>Hi! This post was written three years ago, in 2019. In this post, my friend Angélica and I share the experience of participating in the Tidyverse Developer Day 2019.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">rstudio::conf 2022</a> is coming up, I thought it would be nice to translate this post.</p>
<p>While translating it, I remembered more about that day and thought about how much I had learned since then. That event was essential for me, and I learned so much 💜. So, thanks to <strong>everyone</strong> involved, specially <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse">tidyverse</a> team that organized this event.</p>
<p>This post was originally published on <a href="https://blog.curso-r.com/posts/2019-08-12-tidydevday/">Curso-R’s blog</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this post, <a href="https://beamilz.com">Beatriz Milz</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com%20/in/angelicacustodio/">Angélica Custódio</a> talk about the experience of participating in the Tidyverse Developer Day 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bea is a Ph.D.&nbsp;student in Environmental Science at the University of Sao Paulo and is one of the co-organizers of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sao-paulo/">R-Ladies São Paulo</a>, which is an organization that aims to promote gender diversity in the R community.</p></li>
<li><p>Angélica has a degree in statistics from UFSCar, and a master’s in Computer Science at UFABC. She is also part of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sao-paulo/">R-Ladies São Paulo</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSP/">PyLadies São Paulo</a>.</p></li>

<section id="what-is-tidy-dev-day" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-tidy-dev-day">What is tidy-dev-day?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dev-day-2019">Tidyverse Developer Day</a> (tidy-dev-day) is a day-long event where attendees learn more about how to contribute to <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. The first edition was at <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/tidyverse/tidyverse-developer-day-2019">rstudio::conf2019</a>.</p>
<p>This was the second edition of tidy-dev-day and was a part of the <a href="https://user2019.r-project.org/">useR!2019 conference</a>, which took place in Toulouse, France. The event happened the day before the start of the conference, bringing together several people who participated in it.</p>
<p>Something to note is that the <a href="https://user2019.r-project.org/">useR!2019</a> organization offered diversity scholarships, providing financial assistance to members of underrepresented groups in the R to participate in the conference. The diversity scholarships were fundamental for the participation of several people from different parts of the world, including the authors of this post (Bea and Angelica).</p>
</section><section id="how-was-tidy-dev-day" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-was-tidy-dev-day">How was tidy-dev-day?</h2>
<p>The event had a <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dev-day-%202019/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> to provide a safe and friendly space for all participants.</p>
<p>In the event, participants had the opportunity to learn how to contribute to the tidyverse. Several developers and maintainers of the tidyverse were present and with a team of helpers. They helped participants, answered questions, reviewed the contributions, and so on.</p>
<p>The material used (instructions, presentations, suggested materials, etc.) is available <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dev-day-2019">in this Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>On a wall of the room, several post-its indicated issues to be worked on, separated by packages and color. The color stated the type of issue (documentation, bug, feature).</p>
<p>Participants could choose an issue to work on during the event.</p>
<p>On another wall, post-its were separated into pull request post-its to be reviewed by <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a> and other maintainers, and post-its that had already been reviewed and accepted!</p>
<p>Another cool thing is that the space had several tables grouped, which helped to work with other people.</p>

<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Photo of the Tidy-Dev-Day, by <a href="https://twitter.com/Dale_Masch">@Dale_Masch</a>.</p>
<p>For those participating for the first time, they recommended issues related to documentation improvements, as they are more natural for those who have never made a package contribution before.</p>
<p>For those who were already more familiar with package development, they recommended bug or feature issues, as they require a greater knowledge of package development.</p>
</section><section id="beas-experience" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="beas-experience">Bea’s experience</h2>
<p>By the time of the event, I have not developed a package yet. So when I arrived at the event, I didn’t knew how packages were structured. In the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3698">issue I chose</a>to work on, the goal was to improve an error message from the function <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/"><code>dplyr::filter()</code></a>, so that the message would conform to the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse style guide</a>. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VYgvY7k.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Photo of the issue I was working on and the unique coin we received that day. Photo by <a href="https://twitter.com/Bea_Milz">@Bea_Milz</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I forked the dplyr repository, cloned it to my computer, and did not know what to do next.</p>
<p>I didn’t knew which directory the functions were in, and I was afraid of changing something and causing an error in other functions of the package… But I’m glad I had help!</p>
<p><a href="https://ildiczeller.com/">Ildi Czeller</a> showed me what directory the functions were in (by the way, it’s in <code>/R</code>), and then I was able to find the file I needed to change and what part of the code was corresponding to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function. That was the first time I heard about <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/">tests</a>, and I had to change the test referring to the error message I was working on.</p>
<p>After making the changes I felt were necessary, I made a <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/4477">pull request</a>. Hadley replied that someone else was also working on this issue and indicated where the person was sitting. So I went there and asked <a href="https://github.com/rundel">Colin</a> (who was working on this same issue) if we could work together.</p>
<p>He was super welcoming! He explained how he was developing the improvement, and I also showed him what I had done. Hadley asked to change some tests, and we worked on it together (in this case, I was mostly learning and asking Colin, because tests were new to me).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zllw6qX.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Legenda:</strong> The <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/pull/4476">pull request</a> was accepted!</p>
<p>It was a unique experience, and I learned a <strong>lot</strong> that day!</p>
</section><section id="angélicas-experience" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="angélicas-experience">Angélica’s experience</h2>
<p>During tidy-dev-day, I worked on issues from <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a>. It was a new experience, and it was gratifying to feel that I learned and contributed to the package.</p>
<p>At the event, several people facilitated the activity. They helped the participants with activities like how to do a fork on GitHub, work on the issue in R, make a pull request, and so on. I had the help of <a href="https://ildiczeller.com/">Ildi Czeller</a>, who was one of the helpers and helped me at every step, giving tips from git settings to teaching shortcuts in Rstudio that made life easier (they are documented <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts">here</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Caption:</strong> Creating a pull request in the ggplot2 package.</p>
<p>The activity promoted the engagement and contribution of everyone, from those who were new to package development, to those who already had a lot of experience.</p>
<p>It was a welcoming space to ask questions and ask for help.</p>
<p>At one point, I was able to talk to <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley</a> and ask questions about an issue I was working on. Understanding better ggplot2 with one of the authors of the package was an incredible learning experience.</p>
</section><section id="final-remarks" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-remarks">Final remarks</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley</a>, more than 40 pull requests were accepted, and almost 30 needed to be reviewed:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote" data-lang="en">
