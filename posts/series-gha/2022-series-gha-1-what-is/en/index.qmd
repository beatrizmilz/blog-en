Hi!
This is the first blog post in the "GitHub Action" Series.
This series of posts are complementary material for my [RStudio Conference - rstudio::conf 2022](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/) lightning talk.

In this post, **I will briefly introduce GitHub Actions and show how you can start using GitHub Actions with R**.

## What is GitHub Actions?

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a feature by [GitHub](https://github.com/) that enables us to automate tasks with code.
For example, we can specify a series of commands to run when activated!

We can do a lot of different automations with GitHub Actions, such as:

-   Downloading and saving a file everyday (such as `.csv` / `.xlsx` / `.json` ..);

-   Running an R script and saving the results into a database, or a Google Sheet, for example;

-   Running web scraping routines;

-   Rendering an RMarkdown or Quarto document;

-   And so on!
    🚀

## How to use GHA in an R package?

GitHub Actions is heavily used in package development for CI/CD.
For example, package developers use GitHub Actions to perform tests in their code, run checking routines, update the documentation and the package's website, among other things.

## What is CI/CD in the context of R packages?

Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice requiring developers to regularly integrate code into a shared repository, after which automated checks and tests are run to verify the integrity of the new code.

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software development methodology in which code changes are automatically checked, tested, and released to production.
**This allows for new package versions to be released frequently.**

The package [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/github_actions.html) helps us set up GitHub Actions in R packages.
It is essential to know that, by default, the Actions created using usethis come from the [r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/examples#readme).
Save this link; it is pure gold.

## 🏆

I would like to thank all the work made by the [contributors of the r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/graphs/contributors).
🏆 This repository was the most significant source of code and content about GitHub Actions for R to me.

:::

Here are some examples of how to set up GH Actions in packages:

-   To perform checks (like `devtools::check()` ) in a package every time there is a change in the code, use:

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::use_github_action("check-release")
```

This is useful because every time there is a check error, we get an email from GitHub ⚠️.
So we know that something is breaking the code and can fix it as soon as possible.

-   To build the package page (like `pkgdown::build_site()` ) every time there is a change in the code, use:

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")
```

This allows the package website and documentation to be always up to date.

## How to use GHA in an R script?

We already know that we can make awesome automation with R packages using GitHub Actions.
But most R users that I know use R Scripts and RMarkdown files in their daily use.
I did not find examples of using GHA with simple scripts (without the package structure) in the [r-lib/actions repository](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/v2-branch/examples/README.md).
So, to do that, we need to get used to how GHA works!

The [GitHub documentation about workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) is an excellent source to learn more about this topic.

First, the automated process made with GHA is called **Workflow**.
The workflow has two main parts: **Events** and **Jobs**.

-   **Events** describe what can start a workflow.
    For example, an event can be "start this workflow every day at 9am", or "every time someone makes a push into the repository" (in other words, there is some change in the code).

-   **Jobs** describes what the computer should do.
    Imagine that it starts with no software installed at all!
    So we need to tell which Operational System (OS) we want our code to run (for example, Ubuntu / Windows/ Mac OS).
    Also, we need to install R and any packages we need to have to run the code.
    After that, we can add the script we want to run in R and then save any generated results.

## Example

Here is an example of a simple Workflow file.
The workflow starts when pressing a button on GitHub (the event), and it installs R and then prints the message "Hello R World!" on the console.

``` yml
# Event - What starts this workflow?
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

# Name of the workflow
name: hello-r-world

# Jobs - What the computer should do? 
jobs:
  write-message:
    # Use Ubuntu   
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest 
    steps:
       # Install R
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v3    
      - name: print-message   
        # Code to execute R script
        run: Rscript -e 'print("Hello R World!")' 
```

## See you in the next post!

This is the general idea of GitHub Actions.
In the next post, I'll write how you can create a GHA that runs an R script and saves the result into the GitHub repository.
Stay tuned!
