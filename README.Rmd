In this repository you can find the code used to generate my blog (in English): <https://beamilz.com/>

The blog was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can find more info on how to create a blog with Quarto in the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

The deploy is made with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), and the comments use [giscus](https://giscus.app/).

```{r echo=FALSE}
number_of_posts <- fs::dir_ls("posts/", type = "directory") |> length()

number_of_talks_pt <- fs::dir_ls("talks/pt/", type = "directory") |> length()

number_of_talks_en <- fs::dir_ls("talks/en/", type = "directory") |> length()

number_of_talks_es <- fs::dir_ls("talks/es/", type = "directory") |> length()

number_of_talks <- number_of_talks_es + number_of_talks_en + number_of_talks_pt
```

As by `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d,  %Y")`, this blog has **`r number_of_posts` blog posts** and content from **`r number_of_talks` talks/presentations**.
