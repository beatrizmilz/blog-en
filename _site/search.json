You can read more about me in the about page, and check my presentations on the talks page.\nI think that some of the blog posts I write would be useful to a broader audience, so I wanted to start blogging in English (or translating blog posts that I wrote).\nMy blog in Portuguese was build using blogdown and Hugo Apéro, and I really like it. I searched if it was possible to adapt the blog that I had to a multi-language blog (so I could have posts in Portuguese, English and Spanish), but I had no success on my quest."

I was excited to test Quarto to create a blog sometime ago, but I really liked my blog with blogdown/Apéro.\nSo when I started thinking about writing blog posts in English, I thought that it would be a good idea to create a separate, brand new blog to store content in English, using Quarto.\nMy blog in Portuguese will continue to exist, and I will continue to post there (in Portuguese). In this blog, I’ll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I’m going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

I have not found a lot of blogs made with Quarto, and I think because it is a new software. So, take a look at these blogs:\n\nNotes from a data witch: A data science blog by Danielle Navarro - Danielle is a data scientist and she has an awesome blog made with Quarto.

GitHub? (Click to expand!)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you to take some time to prepare your environment and configure everything before continuing reading this post.\nYou can read detailed information about how to do this in the book Happy Git with R.\nHere is a useful check-list you can use:\n\n\nInstall Git on your computer\n\nCreate a free account on GitHub\n\nInstall package usethis: install.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nIntroduce yourself to Git:\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # your name\n  user.name = \"Captain Marvel\",\n  # your email used in your GitHub account\n  user.email = \"awesomecaptain@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub PAT Token with usethis::create_github_token() (is like a password)\n\nStore your token with gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nRestart your R Session (usually CTRL + SHIFT + F10 will do the work)\n\nUse usethis::git_sitrep() to check if your name, email and PAT are configured. The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check how I configured this in this file.\nWrite about yourself, so people can get to know you. You can do that in the about.qmd file. There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant. You can change the template of this page, in the template option. You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

I was excited to test Quarto to create a blog sometime ago, but I really liked my blog with blogdown/Apéro.\nSo when I started thinking about writing blog posts in English, I thought that it would be a good idea to create a separate, brand new blog to store content in English, using Quarto.\nMy blog in Portuguese will continue to exist, and I will continue to post there (in Portuguese). In this blog, I’ll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I’m going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

This post aims to describe how as it, in order to possibly offer information and help other people interested to undertake this training.\nRStudio offers the possibility to do the instructor certification on the packages tidyverse and shiny. All the necessary information is available on this site, but I will add some extra links here as well!\n\nImportant: I did the entire training process with Greg Wilson, however he is no longer involved with it. So I don’t know if any of the steps have changed. Here I will describe what the process was when I did the training."

    "text": "The importance of the R community\nFirst of all: I would like to point out that the R community was essential for me to be able to take this training.\nWhen I found out about the existence of this certification, I soon came across a difficulty to participate: on the website it said that it was necessary to pay (in dollars) to do the training.\nFor those who are Brazilians, we know how the local currency is very devalued, and this ends up making it difficult for many Brazilian people to participate. So I let it go, until I saw a post on Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about the training and certification that she took.\nI got in touch with her (who I had met in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nFor this study group, we created a Slack channel, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams, and to feel confident in taking them."

Para quem é Brasileiro, sabemos como a moeda local é muito desvalorizada, e isso acaba dificultando a participação de muitas pessoas.Então eu deixei pra lá, até que vi um post no blog da Yanina Saibene falando como foi o processo de certificação para ela. Então entrei em contato com ela (que havia conhecido pessoalmente na LatinR 2019) para saber mais sobre como foi o processo para ela.\nEla me colocou em contato com um grupo de pessoas que fazem parte de diversos capítulos da R-Ladies na América Latina, que estavam se organizando para começar um grupo de estudos (e apoio!) para realizar o processo. Além disso, também me deu mais informações sobre como fazer o processo de forma mais acessível financeiramente.\nPara esse grupo de estudos, foi criado um canal no Slack, onde eram compartilhadas dicas, resoluções de exercícios e dúvidas, entre outros. Além disso, nos encontravamos semanalmente via zoom para discutir os capítulos do livro R for Data Science (também disponível em Espanhol neste link).\nA orientação da Yanina Saibene e os estudos em grupo foram essenciais para que eu me preparasse para as provas, e me sentisse confiante em realizá-las."

    "text": "Importância da comunidade\nPrimeiro de tudo: eu gostaria de destacar que a comunidade de R foi essencial para que eu pudesse realizar o treinamento e receber a certificação.\nQuando eu fiquei sabendo da existência dessa certificação, eu logo me deparei com uma dificuldade para participar: no site dizia que era necessário pagar (em dólares) para realizar o processo. Para quem é Brasileiro, sabemos como a moeda local é muito desvalorizada, e isso acaba dificultando a participação de muitas pessoas.Então eu deixei pra lá, até que vi um post no blog da Yanina Saibene falando como foi o processo de certificação para ela. Então entrei em contato com ela (que havia conhecido pessoalmente na LatinR 2019) para saber mais sobre como foi o processo para ela.\nEla me colocou em contato com um grupo de pessoas que fazem parte de diversos capítulos da R-Ladies na América Latina, que estavam se organizando para começar um grupo de estudos (e apoio!) para realizar o processo. Além disso, também me deu mais informações sobre como fazer o processo de forma mais acessível financeiramente.\nPara esse grupo de estudos, foi criado um canal no Slack, onde eram compartilhadas dicas, resoluções de exercícios e dúvidas, entre outros. Além disso, nos encontravamos semanalmente via zoom para discutir os capítulos do livro R for Data Science (também disponível em Espanhol neste link).\nA orientação da Yanina Saibene e os estudos em grupo foram essenciais para que eu me preparasse para as provas, e me sentisse confiante em realizá-las."

Os materiais que eu preparei estão disponibilizados nesta página: https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/ (e o código também está disponível neste repositório no GitHub.\nEu utilizei ferramentas como uma página onde o material é disponibilizado feita com o pacote distill (Allaire et al. 2021), a apresentação feita com o pacote xaringan (Xie 2022), dois exercícios para serem feitos ao final da aula utilizando o pacote learnr (Schloerke et al. 2021), a demonstração com código ao vivo foi realizada usando a IDE RStudio, e um mapa conceitual elaborado com a ferramenta CMap Tools. Porém essas são as ferramentas que eu escolhi utilizar, e eu recomendo que você utilize o que estiver mais confortável para você! A única ferramenta que é obrigatória a ser utilizada nessa etapa é a IDE RStudio (o que é fácil de entender o motivo…).\n\n\nProva sobre tidyverse\nA prova de tidyverse consistiu em resolver diversos exercícios usando R e tidyverse. A recomendação da RStudio para estudar para essa prova é a leitura do livro R for Data Science.\nNão tenho muito a falar desta etapa, apenas que pratique e use o quanto possível no seu dia-a-dia, assim você terá mais experiência e conseguirá resolver os problemas mais rapidamente durante a prova.\n\nQuero ainda escrever um post sobre algumas funções que não são tão comuns, mas que foram úteis para a prova!

So I let it go until I saw a post by Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about her experience in the training and certification.\nI talked to Yani (I met her in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nWe created a Slack channel for this study group, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions, and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams and to feel confident in taking them."

In this link it is possible to access an example of exams made available by RStudio for study.\nThere was no correct order to take the exams! Another critical point is that the exams happened with the shared screen, and I could use Google search. But the exam had a time limit, so it was essential to pay attention to the time spent searching!\n\nTeaching exam\nThe teaching exam consisted of a 15-minute demonstration class and answering some questions about teaching.\nI had to send the materials used in the demonstration class beforehand. The materials I prepared are available on this page: https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/ (and the code is also available in this GitHub repository.\nI created a page for the material using the package distill (Allaire et al. 2021), the presentation with the package xaringan (Xie 2022), two exercises using the package learnr (Schloerke et al. 2021), the live code demo was using the RStudio IDE, and a concept map created with the tool CMap Tools. But these are the tools that I choose to use, and I recommend that you use whichever is most comfortable for you! The only mandatory tool to be used in this step is the RStudio IDE (which is easy to understand why…).\n\n\ntidyverse exam\nThe tidyverse exam consisted of solving several exercises using R and tidyverse. The recommendation from RStudio is to read the book R for Data Science.\nI don’t have much to say about this step; practice and use it as much as possible in your daily life and work, so you’ll have more experience and solve problems faster during the exam."

    "text": "Pacote dados\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO pacote dados disponibiliza a tradução de várias bases de dados que são originalmente disponíveis em outros pacotes de R.\nO pacote começou a ser desenvolvido em Junho de 2020, e é um irmão do pacote datos. O datos foi desenvolvido para ser usado na tradução do livro R para Ciência de Dados em espanhol, feita volutariamente pela comunidade Latino-Americana de R.\nUm destaque importantíssimo é que as traduções do pacote dados foram feitas voluntariamente por pessoas da comunidade Latino-Americana de R, contando com a colaboração de pessoas que fazem parte da Latin-R, R-Ladies e Curso-R, sendo elas: Riva Quiroga, Sara Mortara, Beatriz Milz (professora na Curso-R), Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, Alejandra Andrea Tapia Silva, Beatriz Maurer Costa, Jean Prado, Renata Hirota, William Amorim (professor na Curso-R), e Emmanuelle Rodrigues Nunes.\nAlguns dos objetivos do pacote dados são:\n\nDisponibilizar bases de dados em português utilizadas para praticar e ensinar R (como em tutoriais, cursos, textos em blogs, livros). Por exemplo, estão disponíveis lá todas as bases usadas no livro R for Data Science, entre outras;\nIncentivar pessoas a ser tornarem desenvolvedoras em R (várias pessoas que participaram do desenvolvimento do pacote e realizaram traduções não tinham experiência anterior com colaboração via GitHub e desenvolvimento de pacotes em R, por exemplo);\nColaborar com a diminuição da lacuna linguística em materiais usados no ensino e prática de R.\n\nO pacote está disponível no CRAN e pode ser instalado utilizando o seguinte código:\ninstall.packages(\"dados\")\nPara que as bases fiquem disponíveis, utilize a função library(dados) ou use com dados::nome_da_base.\nTodas as bases possuem a documentação traduzida também. Você pode conferir na aba Help, usando ?dados::nome_da_base ou conferindo na documentação online do pacote.\nExistem bases bem legais disponíveis, como:\n\nStar Wars\n\n\nA base de dados de personagens da franquia Star Wars, disponibilizada originalmente no pacote dplyr. Por isso, é esperado que seja bastante útil em exemplos de manipulação de dados. Porém podemos criar visualizações bem legais também usando esses dados! Aliás, essa é a base utilizada no desafio 3, focado em visualização de dados, com o objetivo de replicar esse gráfico:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspie a base por aqui:\n\ndplyr::glimpse(dados::dados_starwars)\n## Rows: 87\n## Columns: 14\n## $ nome            <chr> \"Luke Skywalker\", \"C-3PO\", \"R2-D2\", \"Darth Vader\", \"Le…\n## $ altura          <int> 172, 167, 96, 202, 150, 178, 165, 97, 183, 182, 188, 1…\n## $ massa           <dbl> 77.0, 75.0, 32.0, 136.0, 49.0, 120.0, 75.0, 32.0, 84.0…\n## $ cor_do_cabelo   <chr> \"Loiro\", NA, NA, \"Nenhum\", \"Castanho\", \"Castanho, Cinz…\n## $ cor_da_pele     <chr> \"Branca clara\", \"Ouro\", \"Branca, Azul\", \"Branca\", \"Cla…\n## $ cor_dos_olhos   <chr> \"Azul\", \"Amarelo\", \"Vermelho\", \"Amarelo\", \"Castanho\", …\n## $ ano_nascimento  <dbl> 19.0, 112.0, 33.0, 41.9, 19.0, 52.0, 47.0, NA, 24.0, 5…\n## $ sexo_biologico  <chr> \"Macho\", \"Nenhum\", \"Nenhum\", \"Macho\", \"Fêmea\", \"Macho\"…\n## $ genero          <chr> \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"F…\n## $ planeta_natal   <chr> \"Tatooine\", \"Tatooine\", \"Naboo\", \"Tatooine\", \"Alderaan…\n## $ especie         <chr> \"Humano\", \"Droide\", \"Droide\", \"Humano\", \"Humano\", \"Hum…\n## $ filmes          <list> <\"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Revenge of the Sith\", \"R…\n## $ veiculos        <list> <\"Snowspeeder\", \"Imperial Speeder Bike\">, <>, <>, <>,…\n## $ naves_espaciais <list> <\"X-wing\", \"Imperial shuttle\">, <>, <>, \"TIE Advanced…\n\n\n\nPinguins\n\nA base dos pinguins foi disponibilizada com o objetivo de ser uma alternativa à base de dados iris. Podemos utilizar essa base para ensinar e praticar principalmente temas de visualização e manipulação de dados.\nAlgo muito legal são as vignettes do pacote original, que apresentam tutoriais sobre como fazer visualizações interessantes com os dados.

Todas as bases foram traduzidas e disponibilizadas no pacote dados! Essas bases podem ser utilizadas para treinar manipulação e visualização de dados. Na minha opinião, essas bases são super interessantes para ensinar os concentos dos joins do dplyr!\nO post ‘Pixar: Uma História de dados’, foi escrito por Fernando Barbalho, e publicado no Blog da Escola de Dados, utilizando os dados deste pacote.

    "text": "Introdução\nRecentemente, escrevi um post sobre como é possível acessar dados do Google Sheets com R, além de importar respostas do Google Forms. Algumas pessoas comentaram que utilizam o One Drive, e perguntaram como funcionaria para importar tabelas que estão por lá. Como eu não uso One Drive, dei uma explorada para responder, e neste post falarei um pouco sobre como podemos importar dados que estão na conta do One Drive usando o pacote Microsoft365R.\nO pacote Microsoft365R é uma interface para acessar o Microsoft 365, e segundo a documentação do pacote, possui funções para interagir com o Microsoft Teams, Outlook, SharePoint Online, e o OneDrive (que é o foco deste post!).\nPrimeiramente, é necessário instalar o pacote:\ninstall.packages(\"Microsoft365R\")\nEntão, podemos carregá-lo:\n\n# Carregar pacote Microsoft365R\nlibrary(Microsoft365R)\n\nAo carregar o pacote pela primeira vez, a seguinte mensagem aparecerá, dizendo que é possível armazenar as credenciais em uma pasta chamada AzureR e perguntando se permitimos que o pacote crie esse diretório. Eu aceitei respondendo com Yes:\nThe AzureR packages can save your authentication credentials in the directory:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/AzureR\n\nThis saves you having to re-authenticate with Azure in future sessions.\nCreate this directory? (Yes/no/cancel) \nDepois de responder com Yes, nada aparentemente acontece, porém o pacote é carregado!"

Como o meu acesso é pessoal, vou usar a função get_personal_onedrive(). Mas caso o seu acesso seja de trabalho, utilize a função get_business_onedrive(). É necessário executar a função e salvar o resultado em um objeto.\nonedrive_da_bea <-  Microsoft365R::get_personal_onedrive()\nAgora a forma de interagir com o pacote é um pouco diferente de como usamos na maior parte das vezes. Isso porque o pacote utiliza objetos que são da classe R6, e que permitem utilizar métodos. O foco deste post não é explicar o que são as classes R6, e escrevi este post pensando em ser útil para pessoas que também não conhecem as classes R6. Caso você tenha interesse em saber mais, deixei alguns links de referência no final do post.\nPara conferir a classe desse objeto, podemos usar a função class():\nclass(onedrive_da_bea)\n#> [1] \"ms_drive\"  \"ms_object\" \"R6\"  \nAo executar apenas o objeto, o console apresenta os métodos possíveis:\ndrive_da_bea\n\n#> <Personal OneDrive of Beatriz Milz>\n#>   directory id: df5a76afb6532845 \n#> ---\n#>   Methods:\n#>     create_folder, create_share_link, delete,\n#>     delete_item, do_operation, download_file,\n#>     get_item, get_item_properties, get_list_pager,\n#>     list_files, list_items, list_shared_files,\n#>     list_shared_items, open_item,\n#>     set_item_properties, sync_fields, update,\n#>     upload_file\nSabendo o nome dos métodos, podemos usá-los usando o seguinte padrão: nome_do_objeto$nome_do_metodo()! Existem vários métodos, e vamos explorar os métodos relacionados à importação. Mas caso você use bastante o One Drive no seu dia-a-dia, recomendo experimentar os outros métodos, como os que servem para manipular arquivos (como criar, atualizar, deletar)!"

    "section": "Introdução",
    "text": "Introdução\nO Google Sheets é um editor de planilhas da Google, que funciona vinculado ao Google Drive (ou seja, os arquivos ficam na nuvem). O pacote googlesheets4 permite interagir com o Google Sheets através do R. Neste post, vamos mostrar alguns exemplos sobre como podemos importar dados usando o pacote googlesheets4.\nPrimeiramente, é necessário instalar o pacote:\ninstall.packages(\"googlesheets4\")\nEntão, podemos carregá-lo:\n\n# Carregar pacote googlesheets4\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\n\nNeste exemplo, usaremos a tabela da base de dados Gapminder, que apresenta algumas informações por país e ano, como a população total, expectativa de vida ao nascer e o PIB per capita.\nPara importar uma tabela que está no Google Sheets, primeiramente precisamos identificá-la para que o R saiba qual arquivo queremos abrir. Uma forma de fazer isso é usando a URL (ou Uniform Resource Locator), que é também conhecido como o link que usamos no navegador.\n\n\n\n\n\nUm exemplo de url é o seguinte, e ele encaminha para essa tabela.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077\nSabendo a URL da planilha, podemos salvar em um objeto no R para facilitar o uso!\n# salvar a url/link da planilha que queremos acessar\nurl_planilha <- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077\"\n\nAutenticação\nPara evitar que alguém que não tem acesso a uma Google Sheet consiga ler a mesma sem permissão, o pacote nos direciona para fazer uma autenticação com uma conta do Google. Esse direcionamento é feito quando usamos alguma função que necessita de autenticação pela primeira vez, e a cada sessão do R (ou seja, sempre que reiniciar), o R perguntará novamente com qual email do Google gostaríamos de autenticar.\nExemplo: No meu caso, eu já autentiquei anteriormente, então ele apresenta os emails já autenticados.\nrespostas_formulario <- read_sheet(url)\n# → The googlesheets4 package is requesting access to your Google account\n#   Select a pre-authorised account or enter '0' to obtain a new token\n#   Press Esc/Ctrl + C to cancel\n# \n# 1: bmilz@curso-r.com\n# 2: milz.bea@gmail.com\nPara fazer uma nova autenticação, basta escolher a opção 0, e uma janela do navegador abrirá para fazer a autenticação:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecisamos então clicar no email desejado, selecionar todas as opções de acesso e clicar em “Continuar”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaso funcione, a seguinte mensagem aparecerá no navegador: Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R. Isso significa que podemos voltar ao R!\n\nDEU ERRO! Caso dê erro ao abrir o arquivo, se certifique que você tem acesso de leitura ou edição do Google Sheets desejado.\n\nAgora podemos experimenta as funções do pacote!\n\n\nFunção sheet_properties()\nA função sheet_properties() permite ver quais abas (chamaremos muitas vezes de sheets, pois é a forma usada no pacote) estão disponíveis na tabela:\n# ver as propriedades da planilha (conseguimos descobrir quais sheets \n# estão disponíveis)\nsheet_properties(url_planilha)\n## # A tibble: 5 × 8\n##   name     index         id type  visible grid_rows grid_columns data  \n##   <chr>    <int>      <int> <chr> <lgl>       <int>        <int> <list>\n## 1 Africa       0  780868077 GRID  TRUE          625            6 <NULL>\n## 2 Americas     1   45759261 GRID  TRUE          301            6 <NULL>\n## 3 Asia         2 1984823455 GRID  TRUE          397            6 <NULL>\n## 4 Europe       3 1503562052 GRID  TRUE          361            6 <NULL>\n## 5 Oceania      4 1796776040 GRID  TRUE           25            6 <NULL>\nCom isso, sabemos que a tabela que informamos tem 5 abas, sendo elas: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe e Oceania.\n\n\nFunção read_sheet()\nA função mais útil (na minha opinião) do pacote é a que usamos para ler os dados: read_sheet()!\nSe usarmos essa função sem nenhum argumento além do url da planilha, por padrão a primeira sheet será importada. Como vimos no resultado da função sheet_properties(), a primeira aba da base contém os dados dos países que estão no continente Africano. Então os dados que serão importados são referentes à este continente:\nplanilha <- read_sheet(url_planilha)\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha)\n## Rows: 624\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Alge…\n## $ continent <chr> \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", …\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 43.077, 45.685, 48.303, 51.407, 54.518, 58.014, 61.368, 65.7…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 9279525, 10270856, 11000948, 12760499, 14760787, 17152804, 2…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 2449.0082, 3013.9760, 2550.8169, 3246.9918, 4182.6638, 4910.…\nPodemos também usar o argumento sheet = para especificar qual aba queremos importar. Podemos fazer a busca pela posição (ou seja, informando um número), ou pelo nome da aba:\n# abrir uma sheet específica: pela posição\nplanilha_sheet_3 <- read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = 3)\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha_sheet_3)\n## Rows: 396\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n## $ continent <chr> \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asi…\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\n\n# abrir uma sheet específica: pelo nome\nplanilha_asia <- read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = \"Asia\")\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha_asia)\n## Rows: 396\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n## $ continent <chr> \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asi…\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\nComo todas as tabelas da base tem a mesma estrutura, podemos usar o pacote purrr para importar todas as abas de uma vez:\n# a função sheet_names permite buscar apenas o nome das abas\nnome_abas <- sheet_names(url_planilha)\n\n# com o purrr, podemos abrir todas as abas de uma vez!\ngapminder_completo <- nome_abas |> \n  purrr::map_dfr(~ read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = .x))\n\ndplyr::glimpse(gapminder_completo)\n## Rows: 1,704\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Alge…\n## $ continent <chr> \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", …\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 43.077, 45.685, 48.303, 51.407, 54.518, 58.014, 61.368, 65.7…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 9279525, 10270856, 11000948, 12760499, 14760787, 17152804, 2…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 2449.0082, 3013.9760, 2550.8169, 3246.9918, 4182.6638, 4910.…\n\n\nOutras funções\nEsse pacote tem muitas outras funções que interagem com o Googles Sheets, mas que não fazem parte do escopo deste post, como criar uma nova aba e escrever dados em uma aba. Essas funções também são muito úteis!\n\n\nE o Google Forms?\nEu gosto muito de usar esse pacote para importar respostas de formulários do Google, pois o Google permite vincular respostas dos formulários em uma Google Sheets.\nAqui mostrarei como fazer isso! Primeiro precisamos criar um formulário (caso ele ainda não exista):\n\n\n\n\n\nAo criar o formulário, podemos clicar em “Respostas” e então clicar no logo do Google Sheets (um quadrado verde com uma linha branca horizontal e outra vertical):\n\n\n\n\n\nO Google Forms irá perguntar qual o nome da Google Sheet a ser criada (ou também podemos selecionar uma Google Sheets que já existe):\n\n\n\n\n\nDepois de selecionar qual a Google Sheet ficará vinculada ao formulário, a Google Sheet será aberta e podemos ver as respostas:\n\n\n\n\n\nCada coluna terá informações de uma pergunta do formulário. Inicialmente, a base terá 0 linhas, pois quando criamos o formulário ele tem 0 respostas. Porém, após alguém responder o formulário, a Google Sheet é automaticamente atualizada e apresentará a resposta. Podemos importar os dados usando a função read_sheet(), como mostrado anteriormente:\nurl <- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ch3aMraacwhNo1sU4Z9b54nWYG8gdl18UfLJMzquL8s/\"\n\nrespostas_formulario <- read_sheet(url)\n\nrespostas_formulario\n## # A tibble: 1 × 2\n##   `Carimbo de data/hora` `Pergunta sem título`\n##   <dttm>                 <chr>                \n## 1 2022-03-08 21:29:01    Opção 1\nÉ isso! Dúvidas, sugestões e críticas, mande aqui nos comentários. Postem também quais funções do pacote vocês gostariam de saber mais!!\nAté a próxima!"

    "text": "PokéAPI\nUm exemplo de acesso à API é buscando na PokéAPI, uma API para buscar Pokémons! E com tantas possibilidades interessantes, porque buscar justamente Pokémons? Essa API tem fins educacionais, portanto é um ótimo lugar para começar a praticar o tema.\n\nO primeiro passo para acessar qualquer API é procurar uma documentação.\nNa documentação do PokéAPI, é mostrado que devemos usar o seguinte padrão:\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{endpoint}/\nIsso significa que devemos fazer uma requisição GET (apenas para consultar dados), começar com a url base (é a parte que não muda: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) e complementar com os parâmetros da busca (que chamamos de endpoint).\nO pacote httr é muito usado para acessar APIs através do R, e disponibiliza uma função chamada httr::GET() para fazer esse tipo de acesso!\nPor exemplo:\n# url_base - nunca muda na mesma API\nurl_base <- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2\"      \n# endpoint - é o que muda o resultado\nendpoint <- \"/pokemon/ditto\"                 \n# precisamos colar os textos para criar o link\nu_pokemon <- paste0(url_base, endpoint) \n# ver como o texto ficou colado\n# u_pokemon \n# > \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto\"\n# fazer a requisição do tipo GET\nr_pokemon <- httr::GET(u_pokemon) \nr_pokemon\nResponse [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto]\n  Date: 2021-12-06 13:16\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n  Size: 22.3 kB\nEsse resultado é um pouco diferente do que estamos acostumados! O que é mais importante de reparar é o status, pois indica se a requisição foi bem sucedida. Status: 200 significa que deu certo! :)\nAs APIs costumam retornar arquivos JSON, e para acessar o conteúdo que foi obtido podemos usar a função httr::content():\nc_pokemon <- httr::content(r_pokemon)\nAo salvar o resultado da função em um objeto, podemos ver que agora a classe dele é uma lista:\nclass(c_pokemon)\n[1] \"list\"\nPodemos manipular essa lista com funções do tidyverse para obter uma tabela, assim fica mais fácil de trabalhar. Mas atenção, da seguinte forma ela ainda não está no formato tidy! Saiba mais o que são dados tidy no material do curso de Faxina de Dados.\nlibrary(magrittr)\ndados_ditto <- c_pokemon %>%\n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE) %>%\n  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) %>%\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    ~dplyr::mutate(.x, dplyr::across(.fns = as.character)), \n    .id = \"id\"\n  )\ndplyr::glimpse(dados_ditto)\nRows: 396\nColumns: 3\n$ id    <chr> \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\",…\n$ name  <chr> \"ability.name\", \"ability.url\", \"is_hidden\", \"slot\", \"ability.nam…\n$ value <chr> \"limber\", \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/7/\", \"FALSE\", \"1\", …\n\nAgora você pode usar o que aprendemos para pesquisar outros Pokémons! Quem sabe explorar a teoria de que o Ditto é um clone falho do Mew?\ndados_mew <- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew\" %>% \n  httr::GET() %>% \n  httr::content() %>%\n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE) %>%\n  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) %>%\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    ~dplyr::mutate(.x, dplyr::across(.fns = as.character)), \n    .id = \"id\"\n  )\ndplyr::glimpse(dados_mew)\nRows: 10,083\nColumns: 3\n$ id    <chr> \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"base_experi…\n$ name  <chr> \"ability.name\", \"ability.url\", \"is_hidden\", \"slot\", \"1\", \"name\",…\n$ value <chr> \"synchronize\", \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/28/\", \"FALSE\",…\nSaiba mais sobre a teoria aqui:\n\n\n\n\nÉ isso!

    "text": "Introdução\nEsse post faz parte de uma série sobre acesso à APIs com R! O primeiro post foi uma introdução sobre como acessar APIs com R.\nNeste post mostraremos um exemplo usando a API do GitHub.\nO GitHub é uma plataforma onde conseguimos hospedar repositórios (pastas com nossos códigos e arquivos) com controle de versão usando o Git, e podemos fazer muitas coisas utilizando a sua API. E como dissemos no post anterior: “o primeiro passo para acessar qualquer API é procurar uma documentação”. A boa notícia é que a documentação da API do GitHub está disponível em Português e é bem detalhada!\nExistem muitas ações possíveis utilizando essa API. O que escolhemos para esse exemplo é buscar os repositórios que pertencem à uma organização.\nSegundo a documentação, para consultar os repositórios que pertencem à organização octokit, podemos utilizar a seguinte busca:\nGET /orgs/octokit/repos\nO equivalente a isso usando o pacote httr é:\n\n# url_base - nunca muda na mesma API\nurl_base <- \"https://api.github.com\"      \n\n# endpoint - é o que muda o resultado\nendpoint <- \"/orgs/octokit/repos\"                 \n\n# precisamos colar os textos para criar o link\nu_github <- paste0(url_base, endpoint) \n\n# ver como o texto ficou colado\n# u_github \n# > \"https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit/repos\"\n\n# fazer a requisição do tipo GET\nr_github <- httr::GET(u_github) \n\nr_github\n\nResponse [https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit/repos]\n  Date: 2022-06-11 22:22\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n  Size: 182 kB\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 417862,\n    \"node_id\": \"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTc4NjI=\",\n    \"name\": \"octokit.rb\",\n    \"full_name\": \"octokit/octokit.rb\",\n    \"private\": false,\n    \"owner\": {\n      \"login\": \"octokit\",\n      \"id\": 3430433,\n...\n\n\nPodemos acessar o resultado usando a função httr::content(), porém não vamos colocar o resultado no post pois ficaria muito longo.\n\n# httr::content(r_github)"

    "text": "Primeiro exemplo com o pacote gh\nNeste exemplo, vamos buscar as informações sobre os repositórios que são organização Curso-R no GitHub, gerar um dataframe, e ao final fazer uma visualização simples.\n\nInformações gerais da organização Curso-R\nPodemos buscar informações sobre a organização da Curso-R no GitHub:\n\ngh_curso_r <- gh::gh(\"GET /orgs/{org}\",\n                     org = \"curso-r\")\n\nA sintaxe do pacote gh é similar ao glue. Quando queremos buscar uma informação que está em uma variável (no caso “curso-r”), colocamos os {variavel} no primeiro argumento e escrevemos variavel= nos argumentos seguintes.\nComo vimos, o resultado é uma lista. Para consultar o número de repositórios públicos, podemos usar o $ para acessar essa informação dentro da lista:\n\ngh_curso_r$public_repos\n\n[1] 313\n\n\nOlha só, a Curso-R tem atualmente 313 repositórios públicos no GitHub! Temos muitos repositórios pois criamos um diferente para cada curso, para que quem faz aula com a gente tenha sempre um lugar para olhar todos os materiais, de forma organizada e independente.\n\n\nAcessando informações de repositórios\nPodemos buscar informações sobre os repositórios que pertencem à organização Curso-R no GitHub:\n\nrepositorios_cursor <- gh::gh(\"GET /orgs/{org}/repos\", org = \"curso-r\")\n\n# A classe que retorna é uma lista\nclass(repositorios_cursor)\n\n[1] \"gh_response\" \"list\"       \n\n# É uma lista grande!\nlength(repositorios_cursor)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nEsse código retornou informações de apenas 30 repositórios. Portanto, precisamos repetir o processo para obter informações de todos os repositórios.\n\n\nIterando com purrr e o pacote gh\nA documentação do pacote aponta que é possível buscar informações de 100 repositórios por vez. Se queremos buscar todos os repositórios, primeiro precisamos calcular quantas vezes vamos repetir o processo todo:\n\nnumero_repos_publicos <- gh_curso_r$public_repos\n\n# podemos buscar 100 repositórios por vez,\n# então podemos dividir o numero de repositorios\n# por 100, e arredondar \"para cima\"\n# (é para isso que a função ceiling() serve!)\nnumero_paginas <- ceiling(numero_repos_publicos/100)\n\nnumero_paginas\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nPrecisaremos repetir 4 vezes! Agora podemos usar a função purrr::map() para repetir o acesso à API quantas vezes forem necessárias para obter as informações de todos os repositórios da Curso-R:\n\nrepos_cursor <- purrr::map(1:numero_paginas, \n                           .f = ~gh::gh(\n    \"GET /orgs/{org}/repos\", \n    org = \"curso-r\", # organizacao\n    type = \"public\", # tipo de repositorio \n    sort = \"updated\", # forma de ordenar a busca\n    per_page = 100, # numero de resultados por pagina\n    page = .x # numero da pagina que será substituido\n  ))\n\nO resultado ainda é uma lista… podemos usar a magia do pacote purrr e transformar essa lista em um dataframe:\n\nlista_repos <-  repos_cursor  |> \n  purrr::flatten() |> \n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE)  |> \n  purrr::map_dfr(tibble::enframe, .id = \"id_repo\") |> \n  tidyr::pivot_wider() |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nlista_repos\n\n# A tibble: 313 × 108\n   id_repo id        node_id        name  full_name private owner_login owner_id\n   <chr>   <chr>     <chr>          <chr> <chr>     <chr>   <chr>       <chr>   \n 1 1       431987860 R_kgDOGb-clA   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 2 2       431987947 R_kgDOGb-c6w   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 3 3       292873974 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 4 4       432004121 R_kgDOGb_cGQ   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 5 5       500593205 R_kgDOHdZyNQ   main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 6 6       311969160 MDEwOlJlcG9za… chess curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 7 7       180506470 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 8 8       176309514 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 9 9       498141879 R_kgDOHbEKtw   anac… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n10 10      414400266 R_kgDOGLM_Cg   muni… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n# … with 303 more rows, and 100 more variables: owner_node_id <chr>,\n#   owner_avatar_url <chr>, owner_gravatar_id <chr>, owner_url <chr>,\n#   owner_html_url <chr>, owner_followers_url <chr>, owner_following_url <chr>,\n#   owner_gists_url <chr>, owner_starred_url <chr>,\n#   owner_subscriptions_url <chr>, owner_organizations_url <chr>,\n#   owner_repos_url <chr>, owner_events_url <chr>,\n#   owner_received_events_url <chr>, owner_type <chr>, …\n\n\nVamos fazer mais uma etapa de organização dos dados: são muitas colunas, e não precisaremos de todas para terminar o post. Também filtramos a base para remover os forks, já que não seriam repositórios da Curso-R originalmente.\n\ndf_repos_cursor <- lista_repos  |>\n  dplyr::filter(fork == FALSE)  |>\n  dplyr::select(\n    name,\n    created_at,\n    default_branch\n  )  |>\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    data_criacao = readr::parse_datetime(created_at),\n    ano_criacao = as.Date(lubridate::floor_date(data_criacao, \"year\"))\n  )"

Lá no post é explicado sobre a questão da substituição do termo ‘master’. Em 2020 a GitHub anunciou que faria a transição para o termo main (principal), e desde então muitas pessoas e organizações estão renomeando a branch principal de seus repositórios para ‘main’(inclusive existe um post no blog da RStudio sobre isso).\nUsando os dados obtidos nesse post, vamos explorar os repositórios da Curso-R e averiguar qual é o nome da branch principal dos repositórios ao longo do tempo?\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmain_percent <- mean(df_repos_cursor$default_branch == \"main\")\nmain_percent <- scales::percent(main_percent)\ndf_repos_cursor  |>\n  dplyr::count(ano_criacao, default_branch)  |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = n, x = ano_criacao, fill = default_branch)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"1 year\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel1\") +\n  labs(x = \"Ano de criação\", y = \"Número de repositórios\", fill = \"Nome da Branch\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÉ possível ver que em 2021 o uso do termo ‘main’ para nomear as branches principais foi muito mais usado!

Os participantes escolhiam uma issue para trabalhar durante o evento, até a realização de um pull request. Em outra parede, os post-its estavam separados em: post-its de pull requests para serem avaliados pelo Hadley Wickham e outros contribuidores, e os post-its que já tinham sido avaliados e aceitos!\nOutra coisa legal é que o espaço disponibilizou diversas mesas agrupadas, o que ajudava a trabalhar em conjunto.\n\nLegenda: Foto tirada no tidy-dev-day, por @Dale_Masch.\nPara quem estava participando pela primeira vez eram recomendadas as issues de documentação, pois elas são mais naturais para quem nunca fez esse tipo de atividade antes. Para as pessoas que já tinham mais familiaridade eram recomendadas issues de bug ou feature que já exigem um conhecimento maior não só do pacote, mas também de como desenvolver a melhoria."

    "text": "Experiência pessoal - Bea\nEu nunca desenvovi um pacote, e ao chegar no evento nem sabia como pacotes eram estruturados. Na issue que eu escolhi, o objetivo era para melhorar uma mensagem de erro da função filter(), do pacote dplyr, para que a mensagem estivesse de acordo com o style guide do tidyverse. \nLegenda: Foto da issue que estava trabalhando, e também da moeda especial que recebemos, por @Bea_Milz.\nInicialmente, eu fiz o fork do repositório do dplyr, o clone no meu computador, e fiquei sem saber o que fazer depois. Eu não sabia em qual diretório ficavam as funções, estava com receio de alterar algo e causar algum erro em outras funções do pacote… Mas ainda bem que tive ajuda! A Ildi Czeller me mostrou em qual diretório as funções estavam (aliás, é no /R), e e então consegui encontrar o arquivo que precisava alterar, e qual parte do código era correspondente à função filter(). Uma coisa que conheci no evento e foi muito interessante é o conceito de testes, pois tive que alterar o teste referente à mensagem de erro que eu estava trabalhando.\nApós fazer as alterações que entendi que eram necessárias, fiz um pull request. O Hadley respondeu que outra pessoa também estava trabalhando neste tópico (haviam duas issues criadas para o mesmo problema), e indicou onde a pessoa estava sentada. Então fui lá e perguntei para o Colin (que estava trabalhando nesse mesmo problema) se poderíamos trabalhar na issue juntos. Ele foi super receptivo! Ele explicou como ele estava resolvendo, e eu também mostrei o que havia feito. O Hadley pediu para mudar uma função usada no teste, e ficamos trabalhando nisso juntos (no caso, eu estava mais aprendendo e perguntando para o Colin, pois os testes eram novidade para mim).\n\nLegenda: O pull request foi aceito!\nFoi uma experiência única, e aprendi muito nesse dia!"

    "text": "No último final de semana, utilizei algumas horas para reformular essa página. Eu utilizava o tema Academic, porém queria algo mais simples, então mudei para o Lithium. Além disso, também habilitei os comentários com o Disqus, habilitei o Google Analytics e também resolvi testar o Netlify (que aliás achei incrível).\nDurante esse processo, algumas dificuldades apareceram… Também lembrei da primeira vez que criei uma página com o blogdown, onde graças à muitos conteúdos online eu consegui colocar no ar depois de várias mensagens de erro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOs conteúdos online, que muitas pessoas disponibilizaram através de posts em blog, livros, documentação, dúvidas no Stackoverflow, me ajudaram muito a conseguir entender como funcionava o processo de criar uma página com o blogdown. Esses conteúdos foram essenciais também para entender como deixar esse site disponível online utilizando o Github (lembrando que a minha formação é em Gestão Ambiental). Porém a maior parte desse conteúdo estava disponibilizado em inglês: foram poucos os materiais que encontrei em português.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLembrei também da conversa que tive rapidamente no mês passado com a Julia, co-organizadora do R-Ladies Niterói, onde disse que seria interessante que ela disponibilizasse online as palestras que ela já fez, para que outras pessoas consigam consultar e aprender com o conteúdo.\nSe você está em dúvida se deve compartilhar conteúdo na internet, eu indico a palestra (em inglês) do David Robinson na rstudio::conf 2019, chamada “The unreasonable effectiveness of public work”.\nAs formas de compartilhar conteúdo apontadas por David são: escrever um post em um blog, escrever um tweet, contribuir com projetos open source, dar palestras, gravar a tela enquanto faz alguma análise de dados e disponibilizar o vídeo, e escrever um livro sobre o assunto.\nNessa palestra, David diz que se você der a mesma dica/conselho três vezes, escreva um post em um blog, assim muitas pessoas conseguem acessar esse conteúdo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPor isso, pretendo fazer alguns posts em português com algumas dicas sobre como compartilhar conteúdo na internet, utilizando R. Não é segredo que eu sou fã dos pacotes criados pelo Yihui Xie, então os temas que pretendo abordar são:\n\nCriar seu currículo com R, usando o pacote pagedown;\nCriar uma página/blog com R, usando o pacote blogdown.\nCriar apresentações com R, usando o pacote xaringan - lembrando que existe uma apresentação sobre esse assunto disponível aqui. O Bruno Lucian se interessou em compartilhar esse conteúdo no blog Dados Aleatórios, então quando estiver disponível eu colocarei o link para o post aqui também.\n\n\n\n\nPara o compartilhar conteúdo, é interessante também utilizar git e Github. Mas considerando que nesse tema já existe bastante conteúdo em português, por enquanto vou focar nas ferramentas com R, que tem menos conteúdo disponível nessa língua.\nO post do William Oliveira, chamado Plano para estudar Git e GitHub enquanto aprende programação, me ajudou bastante a entender como começar a usar o git. Nesse post ele utiliza o terminal, e para algumas pessoas que estão iniciando essa abordagem pode ser um pouco intimidadora.\nOutra opção para quem está iniciando é utilizar o Github Desktop. Acredito que é uma interface amigável para quem está aprendendo como funciona o git.\n\n\n\nPretendo postar sobre esses conteúdos logo logo. Enquanto isso, estou aberta à sugestões. Existem outras formas que vocês usam para divulgar conteúdo utilizando R? Existe alguma que você conheça e gostaria de aprender mais? Existem dificuldades? Se sim, quais?"

Porém, quando estava no mestrado, precisava utilizar a linguagem R para realizar análises estatísticas com os dados que coletei. Nunca me imaginei aprendendo a programar, e até tentei utilizar sozinha o R em 2017 (sem o RStudio), mas tive muita dificuldade. Então outra pessoa me ajudou com essas análises.\nDepois que conclui o mestrado, no segundo semestre de 2018, passei alguns meses me preparando e participando do processo seletivo do doutorado, e pensei que seria uma boa época para tentar aprender a “mexer com o R”. Eu queria conseguir fazer minhas próprias análises estatísticas sozinha! Perguntei para uma amiga, a Ana Lu, e ela me deu algumas dicas."

Foi um ótimo workshop e fiquei bem feliz de conseguir acompanhar os exercícios.\nQuando voltei do evento, não queria parar de estudar e praticar o que comecei a aprender. Então recebi um email da Curso-R comunicando que havia turma aberta para o curso de Dashboards com R. Eu já havia participado de dois cursos da Curso-R (Introdução à programação em R e Webscrapping em R), e sabia que os cursos oferecidos eram muito bons.

A página permite o download de uma tabela contendo o ISSN, título do periódico, área de avaliação e a nota na respectiva área. Utilizei os dados da avaliação mais recente disponível em junho/2019: 2013-2016.\nA IDE que utilizei foi o RStudio, e os pacotes que usados foram:\n\nshiny - usado para criar a plataforma interativa;\nshinydashboard - permite fazer dashboards com o shiny. Com a ajuda de CSS, consegui personalizar as cores do meu dashboard;\nshinyWidgets - oferece inputs diferentes, utilizei o sliderTextInput().\nDT - esse pacote permite usar tabelas no R utilizando a biblioteca JavaScript DataTables.\ntidyverse - readr, dplyr, purrr e stringr - usei os pacotes que fazem parte do tidyverse em diversas etapas do processo, como ler a base de dados, filtrar, manipular, alterar, entre outros;\njanitor - usei a função janitor::clean_names() , que permite alterar nome de todas as colunas da base de dados, deixando-as no padrão snake_case.\n\nO deploy foi feito gratuitamente no shinyapps.io, diretamente do RStudio!\nA maior dificuldade que tive com esse dashboard foi o filtro que gera a tabela. Inicialmente, ele não resultava o que eu precisava… eu fiquei cerca de duas semanas com esse problema, até que levei para os professores da Curso-R na última aula. Agradeço imensamente ao Julio Trecenti e ao William Amorim, que solucionaram o problema! Sem a ajuda que recebi, esse Shiny App ainda estaria apenas no meu computador…\nPor outro lado, é muito gratificante ver tudo funcionando, ter ideias e conseguir implementá-las! Mostrei para algumas pessoas, que deram feedbacks sobre as dificuldades que tiveram ao utilizar a página. Isso foi muito importante também para aprimorar o Shiny App."

Esses workshops são realizados por instrutores(as) que recebem um treinamento e são certificados.\nLeia abaixo a missão e visão da The Carpentries:\n\nVisão: Nossa visão é ser a comunidade inclusiva líder em ensino de dados e habilidades de programação. Missão: A Carpentries desenvolve capacidade global em dados essenciais e habilidades computacionais para conduzir pesquisas eficientes, abertas e reproduzíveis. Treinamos e promovemos uma comunidade ativa, inclusiva e diversificada de alunos e instrutores que promove e modela a importância do software e dos dados na pesquisa. Colaboramos no desenvolvimento de lições abertas e entregamos essas lições usando práticas de ensino baseadas em evidências. Focamos nas pessoas que conduzem e apoiam pesquisas. Fonte: https://carpentries.org/about/\n\nUm ponto que acredito ser indispensável em qualquer comunidade é ter um código de conduta. Na The Carpentries, o código de conduta é continuamente discutido e aprimorado!\nA The Carpentries engloba 3 projetos: Data Carpentry, Software Carpentry e Library Carpentry. Cada projeto tem um foco, mas todos criam materiais de ensino e promovem workshops sobre R, Python, Git e muito mais.\nSegue abaixo uma lista de materiais sobre R disponíveis nos projetos:\n\nData Carpentry\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists\nIntroduction to R for Geospatial Data\nIntroduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R\n\nSoftware Carpentry\n\nProgramming with R\nR for Reproducible Scientific Analysis\n\nLibrary Carpentry\n\nIntroduction to R\n\n\nOs materiais são desenvolvidos em inglês. Alguns materiais estão sendo traduzidos para espanhol, sendo uma iniciativa da comunidade da The Carpentries na América Latina.

Mesmo com poucos meses de aprendizado, eu declarei interesse em participar. Na ocasião, a Haydee Svab e a Alissa Mune também participaram.\nEste curso ocorreu em dezembro de 2018, e utilizou o método da Carpentries de ensino, e também os materiais. O material utilizado foi o Programming with R, da Software Carpentry. Eu ministrei os conteúdos de Boas práticas (Best Practices for Writing R Code), e Relatórios dinâmicos com o knitr (Dynamic Reports with knitr), pois eram os conteúdos que eu tinha mais familiaridade. Foi uma oportunidade muito boa, onde eu aprendi bastante, e também conheci R-Ladies de outros capítulos da América Latina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-Ladies no 2018 CODATA: Andrea Tapia - R-Ladies Rio de Janeiro, Natalia da Silva - R-Ladies Montevideo, Alissa Mune - R-Ladies São Paulo, Haydee Svab - R-Ladies São Paulo, eu, e Marcela Alfaro - R-Ladies San José.\n\nNessa ocasião, a Marce explicou o que é a Carpentries, disse que temos poucos instrutores(as) no Brasil, e me motivou a me inscrever no processo para fazer o treinamento para ser uma instrutora."

A primeira etapa foi preencher este formulário online registrando o interesse em realizar o treinamento. Eu preenchi em março de 2019.\n\n\nEmail de aceite\nNo início de abril de 2019, recebi o email em que indicava o link para me inscrever no treinamento. No site, são disponíveis diversas opções de datas e horários. Eu me inscrevi para realizar o treinamento em Julho/2019, pois o mesmo tem duração de 2 dias (online), e no primeiro semestre eu estava ocupada com as disciplinas da pós.\n\n\nTreinamento\nO treinamento foi realizado em Julho/2019 através do Zoom (online), com duração de 2 dias. É importante destacar que o treinamento foi inteiramente realizado em inglês. Nesta página é possível ver os conteúdos abordados. O curso foca em boas práticas para o ensino, e foi riquíssimo, contando com atividades práticas. Uma das minhas atividades favoritas foi em grupo: cada pessoa do grupo deveria compartilhar a tela do computador e apresentar uma curta aula, e os participantes do grupo fornecem feedbacks positivos e negativos.\nDepois de completar o treinamento, existem 3 etapas para concluir o checkout process: participar de uma reunião da comunidade (community discussion), fazer uma contribuição em algum material da Carpentries, e apresentar uma aula de 5 minutos codando ao vivo (live coding). Essas etapas devem ser realizadas em até 3 meses após participar do treinamento online.\n\n\nCommunity discussion\nPara participar da community discussion, existe um documento com diversas opções de horários e datas. Eu coloquei meu nome em uma opção de data que eu poderia participar. A reunião é online e dura 1 hora, e participaram pessoas que estão no treinamento, e também instrutores(as) experientes.\nFoi muito interessante ouvir as pessoas contando quais foram os aprendizados que tiveram nos workshops oferecidos. Algo que eu achei muito interessante são os relatos do que errado nos workshops, pois assim podemos pensar em formas de prevenir estes problemas em workshops futuros!\n\n\nContribuindo com os materiais\nComo disse anteriormente, todos os materiais da Carpentries são desenvolvidos e aprimorados pela comunidade, através do GitHub. Então parte do treinamento é realizar uma contribuição, seja com um pull request, respondendo uma issue ou dando alguma sugestão/feedback.\nEu estava estudando uma das lições da Data Carpentry para me preparar para a etapa de live coding. Em Agosto/2019, fiz uma contribuição respondendo uma issue com uma sugestão relacionado à lição Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists.\n\n\nLive Coding\nEssa foi a última etapa, que realizei em Setembro/2019! A dinâmica é a seguinte: deve-se escolhar uma lição da Carpentries (eu escolhi essa), e estudar o material.\nDepois de estudar o conteúdo da lição Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists, adicionei meu nome e a lição escolhida no documento com as datas disponíveis para o Live Coding.\nA avaliação é realizada em uma ligação no Zoom, com outras pessoas que estão em treinamento e uma pessoa avaliadora. A pessoa avaliadora então escolhe em qual tópico do curso a aula com live coding deve começar (por isso é necessário estudar todo o material escolhido!).\nEntão eu compartilhei a minha tela com todos(as), abri o RStudio, e dei uma aula de 5 minutos em inglês, com live coding, utilizando as práticas que aprendemos no treinamento. Depois de apresentar a aula, é necessário fazer um feedback de si mesmo (positivo e negativo). O feedback que eu fiz para mim mesma é que senti que eu parava para pensar no termo em inglês, e isso prejudicava o ritmo da aula. A pessoa que estava avaliando me tranquilizou e disse que isso não afetou a qualidade da aula. As outras pessoas que estavam em treinamento elaboraram feedbacks, o que me deixou super feliz, já que recebi feedbacks bem legais (um exemplo foi falarem que a minha voz e jeito de falar é animada e deixou as pessoas interessadas no conteúdo apresentado).\nDepois de apresentar e receber os feedbacks, também assisti as aulas de outras pessoas em treinamento, e dei feedbacks.\n\n\nConcluindo o Checkout Process\nDepois de cumprir todas essas etapas e informar por email (por exemplo, o link da issue que contribuí), esperei um tempo e verifiquei neste site que já havia cumprido os requisitos. Preenchi os dados que faltavam, e em pouco tempo o meu nome apareceu na lista de instrutores(as): (é preciso utilizar o ctrl+F, pois são muitas pessoas!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint screen da página de instrutores(as) da Carpentries. Fonte: Carpentries - Our Instructors.\n\nDesde então, posso organizar e dar aula em Workshops da Carpentries. Eu e o Raniere Silva estamos em contato com ideias de organizar workshops neste ano!\nEu aprendi bastante neste treinamento, o que possibilitou ter um olhar crítico sobre as aulas e materiais que eu (e outras pessoas também) ofereço. Desenvolver a habilidade de fornecer feedbacks construtivos, e praticar live coding foram conteúdos que também gostei muito no treinamento da Carpentries."

    "text": "Desafios para a comunidade Carpentries no Brasil\nDentre os desafios que percebi, o que mais chama a atenção é que o treinamento para se tornar uma pessoa instrutora é totalmente em inglês. Isso acaba dificultando a participação de muitas pessoas que não falam inglês. Além disso, existem poucos instrutores(as) certificados no Brasil. Consequentemente o material dos workshops estão em inglês, pois ainda não foram traduzidos.\nNos países da América Latina que falam espanhol, as pessoas instrutoras trabalham em equipe para traduzir os materiais dos workshops, e também já ofereceram o treinamento para instrutores(as) em espanhol.\nPortanto, se queremos ter materiais e workshops em português, é essencial que a comunidade da Carpentries cresça no Brasil!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscrevi este post com o objetivo de deixar mais claro como foi este processo. Estou à disposição em caso de outras dúvidas:  milz.bea@gmail.com e  telegram."

A função download.file() possibilita fazer download de arquivos diretamente do R.\n\n# Link do relatório\nurl <-\n  \"https://cetesb.sp.gov.br/aguas-interiores/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2019/10/Ap%C3%AAndice-C_Dados-de-Saneamento-por-Munic%C3%ADpio.pdf\" \n\n\n#Fazer o download do arquivo PDF\n\ndownload.file(url, # URL do arquivo a ser baixado\n              destfile = \"dados/apendice_c_2018.pdf\", # Informar onde quer que seja salvo, e com qual nome e extensão \n              method = \"curl\" # Método utilizado para o download\n              )\n\nPara fazer a conversão, utilizei o pacote {pdftables} (Persson 2016), que possibilita converter o arquivo PDF para CSV diretamente do R, através da API (e omiti a minha chave da API no código):\n\nO que é API?\nÉ a sigla para “Application Programming Interfaces”, ou em português, “Interface de programação de aplicações”.\nNeste exemplo, caso não fosse utilizar a API, seria necessário realizar o upload do arquivo PDF no site PDFTables, e depois baixar o arquivo convertido.\nPara utilizar a API, é necessário fazer um cadastro no site, e na aba API é disponibilizado a chave da API para utilizá-la. Posteriormente, pode-se utilizar a função pdftables::convert_pdf() para fazer a conversão diretamente do R. Isso é muito útil quando temos uma grande quantidade de arquivos, e também para deixar registrado a etapa realizada.\nCaso queira saber mais sobre APIs, leia essa página do material da Curso-R.\n\n\n# Converter o arquivo PDF em CSV. Utilizei a API que obtive no site, mas para compilar, omiti a API key.\n\npdftables::convert_pdf(\"dados/apendice_c_2018.pdf\",\n                       # Arquivo para converter\n                       output_file = \"dados/apendice_c_2018.csv\",\n                       #  Informar onde quer o arquivo gerado\n                       # seja salvo, e com qual nome e extensão\n                       api_key = \"...\" # Chave da API, gerada através do site.\n                       )\n\nA tabela convertida em .csv pode ser acessada neste link. O próximo passo é carregar a base, usando a função readr::read_csv():\n\napendice_c_2018 <-\n  readr::read_csv(\n    \"dados/apendice_c_2018.csv\", # Qual arquivo CSV quero carregar\n    col_names = c(\n      # define o nome das colunas\n      \"ugrhi\",\n      \"municipio\",\n      \"consessao\",\n      \"pop_urbana\",\n      \"atendimento_coleta_porc\",\n      \"atendimento_tratamento_porc\",\n      \"eficiencia\",\n      \"carga_poluidora_potencial\",\n      \"carga_poluidora_remancescente\",\n      \"ictem\",\n      \"corpo_receptor\"\n    ),\n    locale = readr::locale(encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\"),\n    # encoding dos dados\n    skip = 5 # Quantas linhas para pular no CSV antes de começar a ler os dados.\n  )\n\n\nEncoding?\nUma das informações importantes que utilizei na função para ler os dados no R, no código acima, é o Encoding. O Encoding está relacionado à codificação dos caracteres. Você já carregou uma base de dados onde os caracteres apareceram desconfigurados, como na imagem abaixo? Provavelmente era um erro de Encoding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAo carregar um arquivo, é util saber em qual encoding ele foi salvo.\nO recomendado ao salvar um arquivo é utilizar o encoding UTF-8.2\n\n\nA base deve conter 645 linhas, referente ao número de municípios no estado de São Paulo3:\n\n\nnrow(apendice_c_2018) # consulta quantas linhas tem na base\n\n[1] 701\n\n\nA base contém mais linhas do que municípios. O código abaixo retira linhas que apenas contém NA, e linhas que não apresentam dados dos municípios:\n\napendice_c_filtrado <- apendice_c_2018 %>%\n  # Filtrar linhas que não contém nome de municípios\n  dplyr::filter(!municipio %in% c(\"Estado de São Paulo\", \"Município\", NA, \"MUNICÍPIO\")) \n\nAgora a base tem 645 linhas, o que corresponde aos 645 municípios do estado de SP.

    "section": "Unir as bases !",
    "text": "Unir as bases !\nA base da CETESB não possui o código de município do IBGE (o ideal para fazer o Join). Neste caso, podemos usar o nome do município, porém é preciso padronizar os nomes em relação à maiúsculas/minúsculas, acentos, presença de traços, entre outros. A maior diferença encontrada foi na grafia do nome do município “São Luiz do Paraitinga”: segundo o site da Assembléia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo, e o site do município, Luiz é escrito com Z, porém a base da CETESB utiliza a forma incorreta: “São Luís do Paraitinga”. Essas inconsistências foram corrigidas com código abaixo, usando principalmente funções dos pacotes stringr, dplyr e abjutils:\n\nmunicipios_sp_limpo <-\n  municipios_sp %>% dplyr::mutate(\n    nome_muni = stringr::str_to_lower(name_muni),\n    nome_muni = stringr::str_replace_all(nome_muni, \"-\", \" \"),\n    nome_muni = abjutils::rm_accent(nome_muni)\n  )\n\napendice_c_limpo <- apendice_c %>% dplyr::mutate(\n  nome_muni =  dplyr::case_when(\n    municipio == \"São Luís do Paraitinga\" ~\n      \"São Luiz do Paraitinga\",\n    TRUE ~ municipio\n  ),\n  nome_muni = stringr::str_to_lower(nome_muni),\n  nome_muni = stringr::str_replace_all(nome_muni, \"-\", \" \"),\n  nome_muni = abjutils::rm_accent(nome_muni))\n\n\nApós arrumar a base, podemos unir com as funções do tipo join_*, do pacote dplyr (Sim, é possível usar as funções do tipo join_* com objetos de classe Simple Feature, porém use-os como o primeiro argumento ao usar a função):\n\n\napendice_c_geo <-\n  dplyr::full_join(municipios_sp_limpo, apendice_c_limpo) %>%\n  dplyr::left_join(ugrhis)\n\napendice_c_geo %>% nrow() # Confirmando se a nova base tem o número de municípios do estado.\n\n[1] 645\n\n\nAo unir as bases, temos colunas duplicadas ou desnecessárias, então é interessante removê-las. Após este procedimento, a base será filtrada para que apenas municípios que fazem parte das UGRHIs analisadas estejam na tibble gerada.\nAlém disso, o valor de porcentagem de atendimento de tratamento de esgoto é um valor de porcentagem em relação ao volume de esgoto coletado. Por exemplo, o município de Bertioga, segundo os dados da CETESB para 2018, apresenta uma porcentagem de coleta de apenas 34 % do esgoto gerado, e uma porcentagem de 100 % do esgoto tratado. Isso significa que 100 % do esgoto coletado é tratado, e não mostra a porcentagem de todo esgoto gerado que foi tratado. Para isso, criei também uma coluna (chamada porc_real_trat) onde é feito esse cálculo (utilizando a função mutate).\n\nsaneamento <- apendice_c_geo %>%\n  dplyr::select(-nome_muni,-municipio,-code_state) %>% # Remove colunas duplicadas\n  dplyr::filter(ugrhi %in% ugrhis$ugrhi) %>% # Filtra a coluna UGRHI. Apenas as UGRHIS que estão na tibble\n                                            # criada, permanecerão.\n  dplyr::mutate(porc_real_trat = atendimento_tratamento_porc * atendimento_coleta_porc / 100) # Cria uma nova\n# coluna, com o cálculo do número real de porcentagem de tratamento de esgoto.\n\nA base final que usaremos na análise contém dados de 171 municípios, que fazem parte de 6 UGRHIs diferentes. A soma da população urbana destes municípios é de 32.79 milhões de habitantes, o que corresponde à 75.1 % da população urbana do Estado de São Paulo (segundo os dados da base completa utilizada nessa análise)."

    "section": "5 Dicas para formatar melhor suas tabelas",
    "text": "5 Dicas para formatar melhor suas tabelas\nAgora seguimos para as dicas!\nPrimeiro vamos carregar o pacote tidyverse:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nO próximo passo é carregar a base que utilizaremos como exemplo: a base de filmes do IMDB.\n\nimdb <-\n  read_delim(\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curso-r/202010-r4ds-1/master/dados/imdb2.csv\",\n    \";\",\n    escape_double = FALSE,\n    trim_ws = TRUE\n  )\n\n\nExemplo 1: Ordenar, formatar dinheiro e nomear as colunas\nNo exemplo a seguir, primeiramente vamos selecionar as variáveis que representam o nome e o orçamento dos filmes (com a função select()). É interessante ordenar a tabela segundo alguma variável, para facilitar a leitura. No exemplo a seguir, vamos ordenar pelo orçamento de forma decrescente utilizando a função arrange(desc(variavel)).\nVamos selecionar apenas as primeiras linhas da base, para facilitar a apresentação neste post (utilizando a função head()), e salvar em um objeto chamado filmes_orcamento (que usaremos nos códigos a seguir).\n\nfilmes_orcamento <- imdb %>%\n  select(titulo, orcamento) %>%\n  arrange(desc(orcamento)) %>% \n  head()\n\nfilmes_orcamento\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  titulo                                    orcamento\n  <chr>                                         <dbl>\n1 Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End  300000000\n2 John Carter                               263700000\n3 Tangled                                   260000000\n4 Spider-Man 3                              258000000\n5 The Dark Knight Rises                     250000000\n6 Avengers: Age of Ultron                   250000000\n\n\nPara variáveis que representam dinheiro, é possível usar a função scales::dollar() para que os valores fiquem formatados como dinheiro (e fiquem mais legíveis!).\n\nfilmes_orcamento %>% \n  mutate(orcamento = scales::dollar(orcamento)) \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  titulo                                    orcamento   \n  <chr>                                     <chr>       \n1 Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End  $300,000,000\n2 John Carter                               $263,700,000\n3 Tangled                                   $260,000,000\n4 Spider-Man 3                              $258,000,000\n5 The Dark Knight Rises                     $250,000,000\n6 Avengers: Age of Ultron                   $250,000,000\n\n\nA tabela anteiror foi apresentada igual a um código que aparece como retorno no console do R, e isso não fica legal em um relatório. Existem diversas formas de apresentar tabelas, mas neste exemplo utilizaremos a função knitr::kable() 1. Além disso, é comum que o nome das variáveis estejam escritas com letras minúsculas, sem acentuação, etc (por exemplo: orcamento). Para que a tabela fique melhor formatada, podemos renomear o nome das colunas usando o argumento col.names da função knitr::kable(), informando um vetor com os novos nomes para as colunas da tabela.\n\nimdb %>%\n  select(titulo, orcamento) %>%\n  arrange(desc(orcamento)) %>% \n  mutate(orcamento = scales::dollar(orcamento)) %>%\n  head() %>%\n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Título do filme\", \"Orçamento\"))\n\n\n\n\nTítulo do filme\nOrçamento\n\n\n\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End \n$300,000,000\n\n\nJohn Carter \n$263,700,000\n\n\nTangled \n$260,000,000\n\n\nSpider-Man 3 \n$258,000,000\n\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises \n$250,000,000\n\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron \n$250,000,000\n\n\n\n\n\nA tabela ficou mais fácil de ser lida. O que achou do resultado?\n\n\nExemplo 2: Arredondar valores e ordenar categorias\nNo exemplo a seguir, vamos calcular a nota média dos filmes na base do IMDB para cada classificação etária. Fazemos isso utilizando as funções group_by() e summarise().\nSalvaremos o resultado em um objeto chamado nota_classificacao (que usaremos nos códigos a seguir).\n\nnota_classificacao <- imdb %>%\n  group_by(classificacao) %>%\n  summarise(nota_media_imdb = mean(nota_imdb, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\nnota_classificacao\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  classificacao       nota_media_imdb\n  <chr>                         <dbl>\n1 A partir de 13 anos            61.8\n2 A partir de 18 anos            64.6\n3 Livre                          62.6\n4 Outros                         66.3\n\n\nO primeiro ponto interessante para arrumar são os valores da variável nota_media_imdb, arredondando os valores para que não apareça as casas decimais. Para melhorar a apresentação, podemos usar a função round() (utilizada para arredondar números) junto com a função mutate() (que altera ou cria novas variáveis). Com o argumento digits da função round(), é possível definir quantas casas decimais você quer que o número tenha.\n\nnota_classificacao %>%\n  mutate(nota_media_imdb = round(nota_media_imdb, digits = 0))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  classificacao       nota_media_imdb\n  <chr>                         <dbl>\n1 A partir de 13 anos              62\n2 A partir de 18 anos              65\n3 Livre                            63\n4 Outros                           66\n\n\nNa base que estamos usando de exemplo, a variável classificacao é uma variável categórica do tipo chr (character), ou seja, um texto. Por padrão, a ordem utilizada é a alfabética (repare no resultado anterior, primeiro aparecem as classificações que começam com A, depois com L e por último a que começa com O).\nPara ordenar essa variável, precisamos transformar ela em um fator. Portanto, usaremos o pacote forcats, que faz parte do tidyverse e possui funções para trabalhar com fatores 2.\nUsando a função mutate() com fct_relevel() (do pacote forcats), podemos alterar a ordem dos níveis desta variável, passando como argumento:\n\na variável que queremos transformar em fator e alterar os seus níveis (os levels),\num vetor com os níveis (levels), na ordem que desejamos.\n\nPosteriormente podemos ordenar a variável utilizando a função arrange(), e teremos como resultado a tabela ordenada de uma forma que faz mais sentido:\n\nnota_classificacao %>%\n  mutate(nota_media_imdb = round(nota_media_imdb, digits = 0)) %>%\n  mutate(classificacao = forcats::fct_relevel(\n    classificacao,\n    c(\"Livre\",\n      \"A partir de 13 anos\",\n      \"A partir de 18 anos\",\n      \"Outros\")\n  )) %>%\n  arrange(classificacao) %>%\n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Classificação etária\",\n                             \"Nota média no IMDB\"))\n\n\n\n\nClassificação etária\nNota média no IMDB\n\n\n\n\nLivre\n63\n\n\nA partir de 13 anos\n62\n\n\nA partir de 18 anos\n65\n\n\nOutros\n66"

    "section": "Dicas para elaborar relatórios",
    "text": "Dicas para elaborar relatórios\n\nContextualize!\nA primeira dica é escrever uma introdução para ajudar a contextualizar a sua análise. Por exemplo:\n\nQual é a pergunta que deseja responder a partir dos dados?\nQual é a base de dados utilizadas? É legal também contextualizar a base.\n\nQual é a fonte destes dados?\nDe qual(ou quais) ano(s) essa base se refere?\nQuais são as variáveis presentes na base de dados?\n\n\nDa mesma forma, é legal também escrever uma conclusão ao final da análise. A pergunta inicial foi respondida? Se sim, qual é a resposta?\n\n\nQuem é o seu público-alvo?\nÉ interessante pensar tambem quem são as pessoas do seu público alvo, e adaptar o relatório para este público. Para quem você está escrevendo?\nPor exemplo, em um relatório de negócios, dificilmente você deixará os códigos visíveis no seu relatório. Por outro lado, em um relatório feito para as pessoas do seu time de cientistas de dados, pode ser interessante deixar os códigos para que saibam o que foi feito na análise.\n\n\nControle como o conteúdo é apresentado!\nOs Chunks nos relatórios feitos com RMarkdown são campos de código onde podemos executar códigos em R. As chunk options (ou opções de chunk), definem como esse código e os resultados gerados aparecerão no relatório final. A seguir estão alguns úteis:\n\nNão é interessante aparecer mensagens de aviso (warnings) e mensagens geradas pelo código no relatório. Para ocultar essas mensagens e avisos, é possível utilizar as seguintes opções de chunk: message = FALSE, warning = FALSE (mas cuidado, pois essas mensagens podem não ser importantes para as pessoas leitoras do relatório, mas podem ser úteis para você!).\nUtilize as chunk options para personalizar como as imagens devem aparecer! Por exemplo:\n\nfig.align='center' - para centralizar horizontalmente as imagens;\necho=FALSE - para não mostrar o código que gera as imagens;\nout.width=\"90%\" - para especificar a largura da página que deve ser ocupada pela imagem (neste exemplo, deixamos 90% para que a imagem ocupe 90% da largura disponível na página).\n\nUtilize as chunk options para personalizar como os códigos devem aparecer! Por exemplo:\n\nApresentar o código e o resultado: echo=TRUE\nApresentar apenas o código, e não executá-lo: echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE\nApresentar apenas os resultados: echo=FALSE\n\n\n\n\nTabelas\nQuando quiser representar dados em tabelas, não esqueça de formatá-las com alguma função com essa finalidade. Por exemplo, primeiro vamos criar uma tabela pequena com os 5 personagens com maior massa presentes na base starwars.\n\n# Carregar o pacote tidyverse\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Criar uma tabela de exemplo\nsw_top5_maiormassa <- dplyr::starwars %>% \n  arrange(desc(mass)) %>% \n  select(name, mass) %>% \n  head(5)\n\nPodemos apresentar esses dados usando apenas o nome da base criada, porém não ficará com uma formatação legal:\n\nsw_top5_maiormassa\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name                   mass\n  <chr>                 <dbl>\n1 Jabba Desilijic Tiure  1358\n2 Grievous                159\n3 IG-88                   140\n4 Darth Vader             136\n5 Tarfful                 136\n\n\nPodemos usar diversas funções para formatar esses dados como uma tabela organizada. Um exemplo de função é a knitr::kable():\n\nsw_top5_maiormassa %>% \n  knitr::kable(col.names = c(\"Nome\", \"Massa\"))\n\n\n\n\nNome\nMassa\n\n\n\n\nJabba Desilijic Tiure\n1358\n\n\nGrievous\n159\n\n\nIG-88\n140\n\n\nDarth Vader\n136\n\n\nTarfful\n136\n\n\n\n\n\nNão esqueça de conferir este post que apresenta dicas para formatar as tabelas!\nConfira também outras funções úteis para gerar tabelas, como por exemplo: gt::gt(), DT::datatable(), kableExtra::kbl() e muitas outras!\n\n\nCódigo em linha\nPodemos adicionar resultados de códigos junto aos textos, utilizando a seguinte sintaxe:\n\n`r codigo_em_r`\n\nPor exemplo, podemos primeiro criar alguns objetos para usarmos no texto:\n\npersonagem_mais_baixo <- dplyr::starwars %>%\n  arrange(height) %>%\n  slice(1)\n\nmedia_altura <- dplyr::starwars %>%\n  summarise(media_altura = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull()\n\nAgora podemos usar estes objetos no texto:\n\nA base starwars, disponível no pacote {dplyr}, apresenta 87 personagens presentes nos filmes. O personagem com menor altura da franquia é o Yoda, com a altura de 66 centímetros. A média da altura dos personagens presentes na base é de 1.74 metros.\n\nO código a seguir gera o parágrafo que apresentamos acima:\n\nA base starwars, disponível no pacote `{dplyr}`,\napresenta `r nrow(dplyr::starwars)` personagens presentes nos filmes. \nO personagem com menor altura da franquia é o `r personagem_mais_baixo[[1]]`,\ncom a altura de `r personagem_mais_baixo[[2]]` centímetros.\nA média da altura dos personagens presentes na base é\nde `r round(media_altura/100, 2)` metros.\n\nSabemos então que os personagens da série The Mandalorian não estão na base, pois o personagem Baby Yoda teria uma estatura mais baixa que o Yoda! Mas um exemplo legal sobre a utilidade do código em linha é pensar que, se algum dia atualizarem a base, este relatório ao ser gerado novamente (através do botão knit) teria seus resultados atualizados também!"

    "section": "Exemplo: Diretores de sucesso!",
    "text": "Exemplo: Diretores de sucesso!\n\nPreparar a base de dados\nNeste exemplo, vamos criar um gráfico que apresente o lucro médio dos filmes segundo o diretor, para identificar pessoas diretoras de sucesso! Primeiro precisaremos obter as informações necessárias para criar o gráfico.\nA base imdb apresenta 3713 linhas, sendo que cada linha possui informação de um filme. Dentre as variáveis presentes na base são o orçamento e a receita dos filmes. Com essas variáveis, é possível calcular o lucro de cada filme. Porém, antes vamos remover os filmes das quais não temos as informações de orçamento e/ou receita (ou seja, NA). Existem diversas formas de remover os valores faltantes - NA - de uma base, então utilizaremos a função drop_na(), do pacote tidyr, indicando como argumento as colunas em que desejamos remover os NA. Depois, utilizando a função mutate(), criaremos uma nova coluna que apresenta o valor do lucro de cada filme:\n\nimdb_lucro <- imdb %>%\n  drop_na(orcamento, receita) %>%\n  mutate(lucro = receita - orcamento)\n\nPara obter a média do lucro por diretor, podemos utilizar as funções group_by() para agrupar por diretor, e summarise() para fazer as sumarizações necessárias: neste caso calcularemos a média (com a função mean()), e também o número de filmes por diretor (com a função n() - que conta o número de linhas, sendo que cada linha representa um filme).\n\nimdb_lucro_diretores <- imdb_lucro %>%\n  group_by(diretor) %>%\n  summarise(media_lucro = mean(lucro),\n            numero_filmes = n())\n\n\nhead(imdb_lucro_diretores)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  diretor         media_lucro numero_filmes\n  <chr>                 <dbl>         <int>\n1 Aaron Schneider     1676553             1\n2 Aaron Seltzer      28546578             1\n3 Abel Ferrara      -11272676             1\n4 Adam Carolla       -1394057             1\n5 Adam Goldberg      -1647420             1\n6 Adam Marcus        13435068             1\n\n\nPorém não podemos apresentar todas as 1419 pessoas diretoras no mesmo gráfico, pois não seria legível! Precisamos definir alguns critérios para selecionar as pessoas diretoras que aparecerão no gráfico.\nO primeiro critério escolhido é ter dirigido mais que um filme! Com a função filter(condicao), esse critério é possível de ser satisfeito. Depois, ordenaremos a base de forma decrescente segundo o lucro médio, assim teremos nas primeiras linhas as pessoas diretoras com os maiores lucros médios. Isso é possível de ser feito com as funções arrange(desc(variavel)). Com a função slice(), podemos ‘cortar’ a base: utilizando como argumento 1:10, estamos solicitando apenas as linhas 1 até 10.\nNeste caso, o resultado destes critérios será uma base com as 10 pessoas diretoras com maior lucro médio e que tenham dirigido mais de um filme.\n\nimdb_top_diretores <- imdb_lucro_diretores %>% \n  filter(numero_filmes > 1) %>% \n  arrange(desc(media_lucro)) %>% \n  slice(1:10)\n\nimdb_top_diretores\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   diretor          media_lucro numero_filmes\n   <chr>                  <dbl>         <int>\n 1 George Lucas      277328296              5\n 2 Colin Trevorrow   252717532.             2\n 3 Pierre Coffin     237275640              2\n 4 Joss Whedon       199202360.             3\n 5 James Cameron     194620985              6\n 6 Roger Allers      188543668.             2\n 7 Pete Docter       158113780.             3\n 8 Francis Lawrence  151100394.             5\n 9 Peter Jackson     132967515              5\n10 Andrew Adamson    130611730              4\n\n\n\n\nCriar o gráfico\nAgora podemos começar a criar o gráfico (e apresentar algumas dicas!).\nO código abaixo apresenta um gráfico de barras (geom_col()) simples, criado com o pacote ggplot2, e vamos melhorá-lo por etapas!\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(x = diretor, y = media_lucro))\n\n\n\n\nA primeira dica é: quando os nomes no eixo x estiverem se sobrepondo (no caso deste gráfico, o nome dos diretores), podemos inverter os eixos:\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro))\n\n\n\n\nAgora está muito mais fácil de ler os nomes dos diretores!\nQuando trabalhamos com variáveis que representam dinheiro (como no caso da variável lucro), podemos formatar os valores para que fiquem formatados como dinheiro, utilizando a função scales::dollar() :\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)\n\n\n\n\nAgora que os eixos estão bem formatados, podemos formatar a legenda para ficar claro o que cada eixo significa! A função labs() permite escrever o que desejamos que apareça como legenda em cada elemento (por exemplo: labs(x = \"Legenda do eixo X\", y = \"Legenda do eixo Y\") .\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n  labs(x = \"Pessoas diretoras\", y = \"Lucro médio\")\n\n\n\n\nÉ interessante também ordenar as barras do gráfico de barras, pois facilita a comparação das categorias (neste caso, as pessoas diretoras).\nPara isso, podemos tratar a variável diretor como um fator (factor) 1, e ordenar os níveis (levels) de diretores segundo a variável media_lucro. A função fct_reorder() do pacote forcats pode ser utilizada para isso, pois ela ordena os níveis de um fator utilizando a ordem de outra variável.\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>%\n  mutate(diretor = forcats::fct_reorder(diretor, media_lucro)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n  labs(x = \"Pessoas diretoras\", y = \"Lucro médio\")\n\n\n\n\nPor último (mas também importante) é uma dica estética, porém tem o poder de deixar o gráfico muito mais atrativo! Existem várias funções no pacote ggplot2 com temas para os gráficos, e elas usam o prefixo theme_ (por exemplo, theme_light()). Além disso, existem pacotes que oferecem mais temas, como o ggthemr e o ggthemes!\nO exemplo abaixo utiliza o tema theme_light():\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>%\n  mutate(diretor = forcats::fct_reorder(diretor, media_lucro)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n  labs(x = \"Pessoas diretoras\", y = \"Lucro médio\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nO exemplo abaixo utiliza o tema flat do pacote ggthemr:\n\nimdb_top_diretores %>%\n  mutate(diretor = forcats::fct_reorder(diretor, media_lucro)) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = diretor, x = media_lucro)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +\n  labs(x = \"Pessoas diretoras\", y = \"Lucro médio\") +\n  ggthemr::ggthemr(\"flat\")$theme"
