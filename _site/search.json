You can read more about me in the about page, and check my presentations on the talks page.\nI think that some of the blog posts I write would be useful to a broader audience, so I wanted to start blogging in English (or translating blog posts that I wrote).\nMy blog in Portuguese was build using blogdown and Hugo Apéro, and I really like it. I searched if it was possible to adapt the blog that I had to a multi-language blog (so I could have posts in Portuguese, English and Spanish), but I had no success on my quest."

I was excited to test Quarto to create a blog sometime ago, but I really liked my blog with blogdown/Apéro.\nSo when I started thinking about writing blog posts in English, I thought that it would be a good idea to create a separate, brand new blog to store content in English, using Quarto.\nMy blog in Portuguese will continue to exist, and I will continue to post there (in Portuguese). In this blog, I’ll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I’m going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

I have not found a lot of blogs made with Quarto, and I think because it is a new software. So, take a look at these blogs:\n\nNotes from a data witch: A data science blog by Danielle Navarro - Danielle is a data scientist and she has an awesome blog made with Quarto.

GitHub? (Click to expand!)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you to take some time to prepare your environment and configure everything before continuing reading this post.\nYou can read detailed information about how to do this in the book Happy Git with R.\nHere is a useful check-list you can use:\n\n\nInstall Git on your computer\n\nCreate a free account on GitHub\n\nInstall package usethis: install.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nIntroduce yourself to Git:\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # your name\n  user.name = \"Captain Marvel\",\n  # your email used in your GitHub account\n  user.email = \"awesomecaptain@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub PAT Token with usethis::create_github_token() (is like a password)\n\nStore your token with gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nRestart your R Session (usually CTRL + SHIFT + F10 will do the work)\n\nUse usethis::git_sitrep() to check if your name, email and PAT are configured. The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check how I configured this in this file.\nWrite about yourself, so people can get to know you. You can do that in the about.qmd file. There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant. You can change the template of this page, in the template option. You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

In this blog, I’ll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I’m going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

GitHub? (Click to expand!)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you to take some time to prepare your environment and configure everything before continuing reading this post.\nYou can read detailed information about how to do this in the book Happy Git with R.\nHere is a useful check-list you can use:\n\n\nInstall Git on your computer\n\nCreate a free account on GitHub\n\nInstall package usethis: install.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nIntroduce yourself to Git:\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # your name\n  user.name = \"Captain Marvel\",\n  # your email used in your GitHub account\n  user.email = \"awesomecaptain@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub PAT Token with usethis::create_github_token() (is like a password)\n\nStore your token with gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nRestart your R Session (usually CTRL + SHIFT + F10 will do the work)\n\nUse usethis::git_sitrep() to check if your name, email and PAT are configured. The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check how I configured this in this file.\nWrite about yourself, so people can get to know you. You can do that in the about.qmd file. There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant. You can change the template of this page, in the template option. You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

    "section": "The importance of the R community",
    "text": "The importance of the R community\nFirst of all: I would like to point out that the R community was essential for me to be able to take this training.\nWhen I found out about the existence of this certification, I soon came across a difficulty to participate: on the website it said that it was necessary to pay (in dollars) to do the training.\nFor those who are Brazilians, we know how the local currency is very devalued, and this ends up making it difficult for many Brazilian people to participate. So I let it go, until I saw a post on Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about the training and certification that she took.\nI got in touch with her (who I had met in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nFor this study group, we created a Slack channel, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams, and to feel confident in taking them."

Os materiais que eu preparei estão disponibilizados nesta página: https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/ (e o código também está disponível neste repositório no GitHub.\nEu utilizei ferramentas como uma página onde o material é disponibilizado feita com o pacote distill (Allaire et al. 2021), a apresentação feita com o pacote xaringan (Xie 2022), dois exercícios para serem feitos ao final da aula utilizando o pacote learnr (Schloerke et al. 2021), a demonstração com código ao vivo foi realizada usando a IDE RStudio, e um mapa conceitual elaborado com a ferramenta CMap Tools. Porém essas são as ferramentas que eu escolhi utilizar, e eu recomendo que você utilize o que estiver mais confortável para você! A única ferramenta que é obrigatória a ser utilizada nessa etapa é a IDE RStudio (o que é fácil de entender o motivo…).\n\n\nProva sobre tidyverse\nA prova de tidyverse consistiu em resolver diversos exercícios usando R e tidyverse. A recomendação da RStudio para estudar para essa prova é a leitura do livro R for Data Science.\nNão tenho muito a falar desta etapa, apenas que pratique e use o quanto possível no seu dia-a-dia, assim você terá mais experiência e conseguirá resolver os problemas mais rapidamente durante a prova.\n\nQuero ainda escrever um post sobre algumas funções que não são tão comuns, mas que foram úteis para a prova! Assim que o post estiver disponível, editarei e adicionarei o link aqui."

So I let it go until I saw a post by Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about her experience in the training and certification.\nI talked to Yani (I met her in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nWe created a Slack channel for this study group, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions, and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams and to feel confident in taking them."

In this link it is possible to access an example of exams made available by RStudio for study.\nThere was no correct order to take the exams! Another critical point is that the exams happened with the shared screen, and I could use Google search. But the exam had a time limit, so it was essential to pay attention to the time spent searching!\n\nTeaching exam\nThe teaching exam consisted of a 15-minute demonstration class and answering some questions about teaching.\nI had to send the materials used in the demonstration class beforehand. The materials I prepared are available on this page: https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/ (and the code is also available in this GitHub repository.\nI created a page for the material using the package distill (Allaire et al. 2021), the presentation with the package xaringan (Xie 2022), two exercises using the package learnr (Schloerke et al. 2021), the live code demo was using the RStudio IDE, and a concept map created with the tool CMap Tools. But these are the tools that I choose to use, and I recommend that you use whichever is most comfortable for you! The only mandatory tool to be used in this step is the RStudio IDE (which is easy to understand why…).\n\n\ntidyverse exam\nThe tidyverse exam consisted of solving several exercises using R and tidyverse. The recommendation from RStudio is to read the book R for Data Science.\nI don’t have much to say about this step; practice and use it as much as possible in your daily life and work, so you’ll have more experience and solve problems faster during the exam."

    "text": "Pacote dados\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO pacote dados disponibiliza a tradução de várias bases de dados que são originalmente disponíveis em outros pacotes de R.\nO pacote começou a ser desenvolvido em Junho de 2020, e é um irmão do pacote datos. O datos foi desenvolvido para ser usado na tradução do livro R para Ciência de Dados em espanhol, feita volutariamente pela comunidade Latino-Americana de R.\nUm destaque importantíssimo é que as traduções do pacote dados foram feitas voluntariamente por pessoas da comunidade Latino-Americana de R, contando com a colaboração de pessoas que fazem parte da Latin-R, R-Ladies e Curso-R, sendo elas: Riva Quiroga, Sara Mortara, Beatriz Milz (professora na Curso-R), Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, Alejandra Andrea Tapia Silva, Beatriz Maurer Costa, Jean Prado, Renata Hirota, William Amorim (professor na Curso-R), e Emmanuelle Rodrigues Nunes.\nAlguns dos objetivos do pacote dados são:\n\nDisponibilizar bases de dados em português utilizadas para praticar e ensinar R (como em tutoriais, cursos, textos em blogs, livros). Por exemplo, estão disponíveis lá todas as bases usadas no livro R for Data Science, entre outras;\nIncentivar pessoas a ser tornarem desenvolvedoras em R (várias pessoas que participaram do desenvolvimento do pacote e realizaram traduções não tinham experiência anterior com colaboração via GitHub e desenvolvimento de pacotes em R, por exemplo);\nColaborar com a diminuição da lacuna linguística em materiais usados no ensino e prática de R.\n\nO pacote está disponível no CRAN e pode ser instalado utilizando o seguinte código:\ninstall.packages(\"dados\")\nPara que as bases fiquem disponíveis, utilize a função library(dados) ou use com dados::nome_da_base.\nTodas as bases possuem a documentação traduzida também. Você pode conferir na aba Help, usando ?dados::nome_da_base ou conferindo na documentação online do pacote.\nExistem bases bem legais disponíveis, como:\n\nStar Wars\n\n\nA base de dados de personagens da franquia Star Wars, disponibilizada originalmente no pacote dplyr. Por isso, é esperado que seja bastante útil em exemplos de manipulação de dados. Porém podemos criar visualizações bem legais também usando esses dados! Aliás, essa é a base utilizada no desafio 3, focado em visualização de dados, com o objetivo de replicar esse gráfico:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspie a base por aqui:\n\ndplyr::glimpse(dados::dados_starwars)\n## Rows: 87\n## Columns: 14\n## $ nome            <chr> \"Luke Skywalker\", \"C-3PO\", \"R2-D2\", \"Darth Vader\", \"Le…\n## $ altura          <int> 172, 167, 96, 202, 150, 178, 165, 97, 183, 182, 188, 1…\n## $ massa           <dbl> 77.0, 75.0, 32.0, 136.0, 49.0, 120.0, 75.0, 32.0, 84.0…\n## $ cor_do_cabelo   <chr> \"Loiro\", NA, NA, \"Nenhum\", \"Castanho\", \"Castanho, Cinz…\n## $ cor_da_pele     <chr> \"Branca clara\", \"Ouro\", \"Branca, Azul\", \"Branca\", \"Cla…\n## $ cor_dos_olhos   <chr> \"Azul\", \"Amarelo\", \"Vermelho\", \"Amarelo\", \"Castanho\", …\n## $ ano_nascimento  <dbl> 19.0, 112.0, 33.0, 41.9, 19.0, 52.0, 47.0, NA, 24.0, 5…\n## $ sexo_biologico  <chr> \"Macho\", \"Nenhum\", \"Nenhum\", \"Macho\", \"Fêmea\", \"Macho\"…\n## $ genero          <chr> \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"Masculino\", \"F…\n## $ planeta_natal   <chr> \"Tatooine\", \"Tatooine\", \"Naboo\", \"Tatooine\", \"Alderaan…\n## $ especie         <chr> \"Humano\", \"Droide\", \"Droide\", \"Humano\", \"Humano\", \"Hum…\n## $ filmes          <list> <\"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Revenge of the Sith\", \"R…\n## $ veiculos        <list> <\"Snowspeeder\", \"Imperial Speeder Bike\">, <>, <>, <>,…\n## $ naves_espaciais <list> <\"X-wing\", \"Imperial shuttle\">, <>, <>, \"TIE Advanced…\n\n\n\nPinguins\n\nA base dos pinguins foi disponibilizada com o objetivo de ser uma alternativa à base de dados iris. Podemos utilizar essa base para ensinar e praticar principalmente temas de visualização e manipulação de dados.\nAlgo muito legal são as vignettes do pacote original, que apresentam tutoriais sobre como fazer visualizações interessantes com os dados.

Todas as bases foram traduzidas e disponibilizadas no pacote dados! Essas bases podem ser utilizadas para treinar manipulação e visualização de dados. Na minha opinião, essas bases são super interessantes para ensinar os concentos dos joins do dplyr!\nO post ‘Pixar: Uma História de dados’, foi escrito por Fernando Barbalho, e publicado no Blog da Escola de Dados, utilizando os dados deste pacote.

    "text": "Introdução\nRecentemente, escrevi um post sobre como é possível acessar dados do Google Sheets com R, além de importar respostas do Google Forms. Algumas pessoas comentaram que utilizam o One Drive, e perguntaram como funcionaria para importar tabelas que estão por lá. Como eu não uso One Drive, dei uma explorada para responder, e neste post falarei um pouco sobre como podemos importar dados que estão na conta do One Drive usando o pacote Microsoft365R.\nO pacote Microsoft365R é uma interface para acessar o Microsoft 365, e segundo a documentação do pacote, possui funções para interagir com o Microsoft Teams, Outlook, SharePoint Online, e o OneDrive (que é o foco deste post!).\nPrimeiramente, é necessário instalar o pacote:\ninstall.packages(\"Microsoft365R\")\nEntão, podemos carregá-lo:\n\n# Carregar pacote Microsoft365R\nlibrary(Microsoft365R)\n\nAo carregar o pacote pela primeira vez, a seguinte mensagem aparecerá, dizendo que é possível armazenar as credenciais em uma pasta chamada AzureR e perguntando se permitimos que o pacote crie esse diretório. Eu aceitei respondendo com Yes:\nThe AzureR packages can save your authentication credentials in the directory:\n\n~/Library/Application Support/AzureR\n\nThis saves you having to re-authenticate with Azure in future sessions.\nCreate this directory? (Yes/no/cancel) \nDepois de responder com Yes, nada aparentemente acontece, porém o pacote é carregado!"

Como o meu acesso é pessoal, vou usar a função get_personal_onedrive(). Mas caso o seu acesso seja de trabalho, utilize a função get_business_onedrive(). É necessário executar a função e salvar o resultado em um objeto.\nonedrive_da_bea <-  Microsoft365R::get_personal_onedrive()\nAgora a forma de interagir com o pacote é um pouco diferente de como usamos na maior parte das vezes. Isso porque o pacote utiliza objetos que são da classe R6, e que permitem utilizar métodos. O foco deste post não é explicar o que são as classes R6, e escrevi este post pensando em ser útil para pessoas que também não conhecem as classes R6. Caso você tenha interesse em saber mais, deixei alguns links de referência no final do post.\nPara conferir a classe desse objeto, podemos usar a função class():\nclass(onedrive_da_bea)\n#> [1] \"ms_drive\"  \"ms_object\" \"R6\"  \nAo executar apenas o objeto, o console apresenta os métodos possíveis:\ndrive_da_bea\n\n#> <Personal OneDrive of Beatriz Milz>\n#>   directory id: df5a76afb6532845 \n#> ---\n#>   Methods:\n#>     create_folder, create_share_link, delete,\n#>     delete_item, do_operation, download_file,\n#>     get_item, get_item_properties, get_list_pager,\n#>     list_files, list_items, list_shared_files,\n#>     list_shared_items, open_item,\n#>     set_item_properties, sync_fields, update,\n#>     upload_file\nSabendo o nome dos métodos, podemos usá-los usando o seguinte padrão: nome_do_objeto$nome_do_metodo()! Existem vários métodos, e vamos explorar os métodos relacionados à importação. Mas caso você use bastante o One Drive no seu dia-a-dia, recomendo experimentar os outros métodos, como os que servem para manipular arquivos (como criar, atualizar, deletar)!"

    "section": "Introdução",
    "text": "Introdução\nO Google Sheets é um editor de planilhas da Google, que funciona vinculado ao Google Drive (ou seja, os arquivos ficam na nuvem). O pacote googlesheets4 permite interagir com o Google Sheets através do R. Neste post, vamos mostrar alguns exemplos sobre como podemos importar dados usando o pacote googlesheets4.\nPrimeiramente, é necessário instalar o pacote:\ninstall.packages(\"googlesheets4\")\nEntão, podemos carregá-lo:\n\n# Carregar pacote googlesheets4\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\n\nNeste exemplo, usaremos a tabela da base de dados Gapminder, que apresenta algumas informações por país e ano, como a população total, expectativa de vida ao nascer e o PIB per capita.\nPara importar uma tabela que está no Google Sheets, primeiramente precisamos identificá-la para que o R saiba qual arquivo queremos abrir. Uma forma de fazer isso é usando a URL (ou Uniform Resource Locator), que é também conhecido como o link que usamos no navegador.\n\n\n\n\n\nUm exemplo de url é o seguinte, e ele encaminha para essa tabela.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077\nSabendo a URL da planilha, podemos salvar em um objeto no R para facilitar o uso!\n# salvar a url/link da planilha que queremos acessar\nurl_planilha <- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077\"\n\nAutenticação\nPara evitar que alguém que não tem acesso a uma Google Sheet consiga ler a mesma sem permissão, o pacote nos direciona para fazer uma autenticação com uma conta do Google. Esse direcionamento é feito quando usamos alguma função que necessita de autenticação pela primeira vez, e a cada sessão do R (ou seja, sempre que reiniciar), o R perguntará novamente com qual email do Google gostaríamos de autenticar.\nExemplo: No meu caso, eu já autentiquei anteriormente, então ele apresenta os emails já autenticados.\nrespostas_formulario <- read_sheet(url)\n# → The googlesheets4 package is requesting access to your Google account\n#   Select a pre-authorised account or enter '0' to obtain a new token\n#   Press Esc/Ctrl + C to cancel\n# \n# 1: bmilz@curso-r.com\n# 2: milz.bea@gmail.com\nPara fazer uma nova autenticação, basta escolher a opção 0, e uma janela do navegador abrirá para fazer a autenticação:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecisamos então clicar no email desejado, selecionar todas as opções de acesso e clicar em “Continuar”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaso funcione, a seguinte mensagem aparecerá no navegador: Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R. Isso significa que podemos voltar ao R!\n\nDEU ERRO! Caso dê erro ao abrir o arquivo, se certifique que você tem acesso de leitura ou edição do Google Sheets desejado.\n\nAgora podemos experimenta as funções do pacote!\n\n\nFunção sheet_properties()\nA função sheet_properties() permite ver quais abas (chamaremos muitas vezes de sheets, pois é a forma usada no pacote) estão disponíveis na tabela:\n# ver as propriedades da planilha (conseguimos descobrir quais sheets \n# estão disponíveis)\nsheet_properties(url_planilha)\n## # A tibble: 5 × 8\n##   name     index         id type  visible grid_rows grid_columns data  \n##   <chr>    <int>      <int> <chr> <lgl>       <int>        <int> <list>\n## 1 Africa       0  780868077 GRID  TRUE          625            6 <NULL>\n## 2 Americas     1   45759261 GRID  TRUE          301            6 <NULL>\n## 3 Asia         2 1984823455 GRID  TRUE          397            6 <NULL>\n## 4 Europe       3 1503562052 GRID  TRUE          361            6 <NULL>\n## 5 Oceania      4 1796776040 GRID  TRUE           25            6 <NULL>\nCom isso, sabemos que a tabela que informamos tem 5 abas, sendo elas: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe e Oceania.\n\n\nFunção read_sheet()\nA função mais útil (na minha opinião) do pacote é a que usamos para ler os dados: read_sheet()!\nSe usarmos essa função sem nenhum argumento além do url da planilha, por padrão a primeira sheet será importada. Como vimos no resultado da função sheet_properties(), a primeira aba da base contém os dados dos países que estão no continente Africano. Então os dados que serão importados são referentes à este continente:\nplanilha <- read_sheet(url_planilha)\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha)\n## Rows: 624\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Alge…\n## $ continent <chr> \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", …\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 43.077, 45.685, 48.303, 51.407, 54.518, 58.014, 61.368, 65.7…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 9279525, 10270856, 11000948, 12760499, 14760787, 17152804, 2…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 2449.0082, 3013.9760, 2550.8169, 3246.9918, 4182.6638, 4910.…\nPodemos também usar o argumento sheet = para especificar qual aba queremos importar. Podemos fazer a busca pela posição (ou seja, informando um número), ou pelo nome da aba:\n# abrir uma sheet específica: pela posição\nplanilha_sheet_3 <- read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = 3)\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha_sheet_3)\n## Rows: 396\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n## $ continent <chr> \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asi…\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\n\n# abrir uma sheet específica: pelo nome\nplanilha_asia <- read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = \"Asia\")\ndplyr::glimpse(planilha_asia)\n## Rows: 396\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n## $ continent <chr> \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asia\", \"Asi…\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\nComo todas as tabelas da base tem a mesma estrutura, podemos usar o pacote purrr para importar todas as abas de uma vez:\n# a função sheet_names permite buscar apenas o nome das abas\nnome_abas <- sheet_names(url_planilha)\n\n# com o purrr, podemos abrir todas as abas de uma vez!\ngapminder_completo <- nome_abas |> \n  purrr::map_dfr(~ read_sheet(url_planilha, sheet = .x))\n\ndplyr::glimpse(gapminder_completo)\n## Rows: 1,704\n## Columns: 6\n## $ country   <chr> \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Algeria\", \"Alge…\n## $ continent <chr> \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", \"Africa\", …\n## $ year      <dbl> 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n## $ lifeExp   <dbl> 43.077, 45.685, 48.303, 51.407, 54.518, 58.014, 61.368, 65.7…\n## $ pop       <dbl> 9279525, 10270856, 11000948, 12760499, 14760787, 17152804, 2…\n## $ gdpPercap <dbl> 2449.0082, 3013.9760, 2550.8169, 3246.9918, 4182.6638, 4910.…\n\n\nOutras funções\nEsse pacote tem muitas outras funções que interagem com o Googles Sheets, mas que não fazem parte do escopo deste post, como criar uma nova aba e escrever dados em uma aba. Essas funções também são muito úteis!\n\n\nE o Google Forms?\nEu gosto muito de usar esse pacote para importar respostas de formulários do Google, pois o Google permite vincular respostas dos formulários em uma Google Sheets.\nAqui mostrarei como fazer isso! Primeiro precisamos criar um formulário (caso ele ainda não exista):\n\n\n\n\n\nAo criar o formulário, podemos clicar em “Respostas” e então clicar no logo do Google Sheets (um quadrado verde com uma linha branca horizontal e outra vertical):\n\n\n\n\n\nO Google Forms irá perguntar qual o nome da Google Sheet a ser criada (ou também podemos selecionar uma Google Sheets que já existe):\n\n\n\n\n\nDepois de selecionar qual a Google Sheet ficará vinculada ao formulário, a Google Sheet será aberta e podemos ver as respostas:\n\n\n\n\n\nCada coluna terá informações de uma pergunta do formulário. Inicialmente, a base terá 0 linhas, pois quando criamos o formulário ele tem 0 respostas. Porém, após alguém responder o formulário, a Google Sheet é automaticamente atualizada e apresentará a resposta. Podemos importar os dados usando a função read_sheet(), como mostrado anteriormente:\nurl <- \"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ch3aMraacwhNo1sU4Z9b54nWYG8gdl18UfLJMzquL8s/\"\n\nrespostas_formulario <- read_sheet(url)\n\nrespostas_formulario\n## # A tibble: 1 × 2\n##   `Carimbo de data/hora` `Pergunta sem título`\n##   <dttm>                 <chr>                \n## 1 2022-03-08 21:29:01    Opção 1\nÉ isso! Dúvidas, sugestões e críticas, mande aqui nos comentários. Postem também quais funções do pacote vocês gostariam de saber mais!!\nAté a próxima!"

    "text": "PokéAPI\nUm exemplo de acesso à API é buscando na PokéAPI, uma API para buscar Pokémons! E com tantas possibilidades interessantes, porque buscar justamente Pokémons? Essa API tem fins educacionais, portanto é um ótimo lugar para começar a praticar o tema.\n\nO primeiro passo para acessar qualquer API é procurar uma documentação.\nNa documentação do PokéAPI, é mostrado que devemos usar o seguinte padrão:\nGET https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/{endpoint}/\nIsso significa que devemos fazer uma requisição GET (apenas para consultar dados), começar com a url base (é a parte que não muda: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) e complementar com os parâmetros da busca (que chamamos de endpoint).\nO pacote httr é muito usado para acessar APIs através do R, e disponibiliza uma função chamada httr::GET() para fazer esse tipo de acesso!\nPor exemplo:\n# url_base - nunca muda na mesma API\nurl_base <- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2\"      \n# endpoint - é o que muda o resultado\nendpoint <- \"/pokemon/ditto\"                 \n# precisamos colar os textos para criar o link\nu_pokemon <- paste0(url_base, endpoint) \n# ver como o texto ficou colado\n# u_pokemon \n# > \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto\"\n# fazer a requisição do tipo GET\nr_pokemon <- httr::GET(u_pokemon) \nr_pokemon\nResponse [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto]\n  Date: 2021-12-06 13:16\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n  Size: 22.3 kB\nEsse resultado é um pouco diferente do que estamos acostumados! O que é mais importante de reparar é o status, pois indica se a requisição foi bem sucedida. Status: 200 significa que deu certo! :)\nAs APIs costumam retornar arquivos JSON, e para acessar o conteúdo que foi obtido podemos usar a função httr::content():\nc_pokemon <- httr::content(r_pokemon)\nAo salvar o resultado da função em um objeto, podemos ver que agora a classe dele é uma lista:\nclass(c_pokemon)\n[1] \"list\"\nPodemos manipular essa lista com funções do tidyverse para obter uma tabela, assim fica mais fácil de trabalhar. Mas atenção, da seguinte forma ela ainda não está no formato tidy! Saiba mais o que são dados tidy no material do curso de Faxina de Dados.\nlibrary(magrittr)\ndados_ditto <- c_pokemon %>%\n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE) %>%\n  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) %>%\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    ~dplyr::mutate(.x, dplyr::across(.fns = as.character)), \n    .id = \"id\"\n  )\ndplyr::glimpse(dados_ditto)\nRows: 396\nColumns: 3\n$ id    <chr> \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\",…\n$ name  <chr> \"ability.name\", \"ability.url\", \"is_hidden\", \"slot\", \"ability.nam…\n$ value <chr> \"limber\", \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/7/\", \"FALSE\", \"1\", …\n\nAgora você pode usar o que aprendemos para pesquisar outros Pokémons! Quem sabe explorar a teoria de que o Ditto é um clone falho do Mew?\ndados_mew <- \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/mew\" %>% \n  httr::GET() %>% \n  httr::content() %>%\n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE) %>%\n  purrr::map(tibble::enframe) %>%\n  purrr::map_dfr(\n    ~dplyr::mutate(.x, dplyr::across(.fns = as.character)), \n    .id = \"id\"\n  )\ndplyr::glimpse(dados_mew)\nRows: 10,083\nColumns: 3\n$ id    <chr> \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"abilities\", \"base_experi…\n$ name  <chr> \"ability.name\", \"ability.url\", \"is_hidden\", \"slot\", \"1\", \"name\",…\n$ value <chr> \"synchronize\", \"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/28/\", \"FALSE\",…\nSaiba mais sobre a teoria aqui:\n\n\n\n\nÉ isso!

    "text": "Introdução\nEsse post faz parte de uma série sobre acesso à APIs com R! O primeiro post foi uma introdução sobre como acessar APIs com R.\nNeste post mostraremos um exemplo usando a API do GitHub.\nO GitHub é uma plataforma onde conseguimos hospedar repositórios (pastas com nossos códigos e arquivos) com controle de versão usando o Git, e podemos fazer muitas coisas utilizando a sua API. E como dissemos no post anterior: “o primeiro passo para acessar qualquer API é procurar uma documentação”. A boa notícia é que a documentação da API do GitHub está disponível em Português e é bem detalhada!\nExistem muitas ações possíveis utilizando essa API. O que escolhemos para esse exemplo é buscar os repositórios que pertencem à uma organização.\nSegundo a documentação, para consultar os repositórios que pertencem à organização octokit, podemos utilizar a seguinte busca:\nGET /orgs/octokit/repos\nO equivalente a isso usando o pacote httr é:\n\n# url_base - nunca muda na mesma API\nurl_base <- \"https://api.github.com\"      \n\n# endpoint - é o que muda o resultado\nendpoint <- \"/orgs/octokit/repos\"                 \n\n# precisamos colar os textos para criar o link\nu_github <- paste0(url_base, endpoint) \n\n# ver como o texto ficou colado\n# u_github \n# > \"https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit/repos\"\n\n# fazer a requisição do tipo GET\nr_github <- httr::GET(u_github) \n\nr_github\n\nResponse [https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit/repos]\n  Date: 2022-06-11 22:22\n  Status: 200\n  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n  Size: 182 kB\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 417862,\n    \"node_id\": \"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTc4NjI=\",\n    \"name\": \"octokit.rb\",\n    \"full_name\": \"octokit/octokit.rb\",\n    \"private\": false,\n    \"owner\": {\n      \"login\": \"octokit\",\n      \"id\": 3430433,\n...\n\n\nPodemos acessar o resultado usando a função httr::content(), porém não vamos colocar o resultado no post pois ficaria muito longo.\n\n# httr::content(r_github)"

    "text": "Primeiro exemplo com o pacote gh\nNeste exemplo, vamos buscar as informações sobre os repositórios que são organização Curso-R no GitHub, gerar um dataframe, e ao final fazer uma visualização simples.\n\nInformações gerais da organização Curso-R\nPodemos buscar informações sobre a organização da Curso-R no GitHub:\n\ngh_curso_r <- gh::gh(\"GET /orgs/{org}\",\n                     org = \"curso-r\")\n\nA sintaxe do pacote gh é similar ao glue. Quando queremos buscar uma informação que está em uma variável (no caso “curso-r”), colocamos os {variavel} no primeiro argumento e escrevemos variavel= nos argumentos seguintes.\nComo vimos, o resultado é uma lista. Para consultar o número de repositórios públicos, podemos usar o $ para acessar essa informação dentro da lista:\n\ngh_curso_r$public_repos\n\n[1] 313\n\n\nOlha só, a Curso-R tem atualmente 313 repositórios públicos no GitHub! Temos muitos repositórios pois criamos um diferente para cada curso, para que quem faz aula com a gente tenha sempre um lugar para olhar todos os materiais, de forma organizada e independente.\n\n\nAcessando informações de repositórios\nPodemos buscar informações sobre os repositórios que pertencem à organização Curso-R no GitHub:\n\nrepositorios_cursor <- gh::gh(\"GET /orgs/{org}/repos\", org = \"curso-r\")\n\n# A classe que retorna é uma lista\nclass(repositorios_cursor)\n\n[1] \"gh_response\" \"list\"       \n\n# É uma lista grande!\nlength(repositorios_cursor)\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nEsse código retornou informações de apenas 30 repositórios. Portanto, precisamos repetir o processo para obter informações de todos os repositórios.\n\n\nIterando com purrr e o pacote gh\nA documentação do pacote aponta que é possível buscar informações de 100 repositórios por vez. Se queremos buscar todos os repositórios, primeiro precisamos calcular quantas vezes vamos repetir o processo todo:\n\nnumero_repos_publicos <- gh_curso_r$public_repos\n\n# podemos buscar 100 repositórios por vez,\n# então podemos dividir o numero de repositorios\n# por 100, e arredondar \"para cima\"\n# (é para isso que a função ceiling() serve!)\nnumero_paginas <- ceiling(numero_repos_publicos/100)\n\nnumero_paginas\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nPrecisaremos repetir 4 vezes! Agora podemos usar a função purrr::map() para repetir o acesso à API quantas vezes forem necessárias para obter as informações de todos os repositórios da Curso-R:\n\nrepos_cursor <- purrr::map(1:numero_paginas, \n                           .f = ~gh::gh(\n    \"GET /orgs/{org}/repos\", \n    org = \"curso-r\", # organizacao\n    type = \"public\", # tipo de repositorio \n    sort = \"updated\", # forma de ordenar a busca\n    per_page = 100, # numero de resultados por pagina\n    page = .x # numero da pagina que será substituido\n  ))\n\nO resultado ainda é uma lista… podemos usar a magia do pacote purrr e transformar essa lista em um dataframe:\n\nlista_repos <-  repos_cursor  |> \n  purrr::flatten() |> \n  purrr::map(unlist, recursive = TRUE)  |> \n  purrr::map_dfr(tibble::enframe, .id = \"id_repo\") |> \n  tidyr::pivot_wider() |> \n  janitor::clean_names()\n\nlista_repos\n\n# A tibble: 313 × 108\n   id_repo id        node_id        name  full_name private owner_login owner_id\n   <chr>   <chr>     <chr>          <chr> <chr>     <chr>   <chr>       <chr>   \n 1 1       431987860 R_kgDOGb-clA   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 2 2       431987947 R_kgDOGb-c6w   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 3 3       292873974 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 4 4       432004121 R_kgDOGb_cGQ   2022… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 5 5       500593205 R_kgDOHdZyNQ   main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 6 6       311969160 MDEwOlJlcG9za… chess curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 7 7       180506470 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 8 8       176309514 MDEwOlJlcG9za… main… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n 9 9       498141879 R_kgDOHbEKtw   anac… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n10 10      414400266 R_kgDOGLM_Cg   muni… curso-r/… FALSE   curso-r     10060716\n# … with 303 more rows, and 100 more variables: owner_node_id <chr>,\n#   owner_avatar_url <chr>, owner_gravatar_id <chr>, owner_url <chr>,\n#   owner_html_url <chr>, owner_followers_url <chr>, owner_following_url <chr>,\n#   owner_gists_url <chr>, owner_starred_url <chr>,\n#   owner_subscriptions_url <chr>, owner_organizations_url <chr>,\n#   owner_repos_url <chr>, owner_events_url <chr>,\n#   owner_received_events_url <chr>, owner_type <chr>, …\n\n\nVamos fazer mais uma etapa de organização dos dados: são muitas colunas, e não precisaremos de todas para terminar o post. Também filtramos a base para remover os forks, já que não seriam repositórios da Curso-R originalmente.\n\ndf_repos_cursor <- lista_repos  |>\n  dplyr::filter(fork == FALSE)  |>\n  dplyr::select(\n    name,\n    created_at,\n    default_branch\n  )  |>\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    data_criacao = readr::parse_datetime(created_at),\n    ano_criacao = as.Date(lubridate::floor_date(data_criacao, \"year\"))\n  )"

Lá no post é explicado sobre a questão da substituição do termo ‘master’. Em 2020 a GitHub anunciou que faria a transição para o termo main (principal), e desde então muitas pessoas e organizações estão renomeando a branch principal de seus repositórios para ‘main’(inclusive existe um post no blog da RStudio sobre isso).\nUsando os dados obtidos nesse post, vamos explorar os repositórios da Curso-R e averiguar qual é o nome da branch principal dos repositórios ao longo do tempo?\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmain_percent <- mean(df_repos_cursor$default_branch == \"main\")\nmain_percent <- scales::percent(main_percent)\ndf_repos_cursor  |>\n  dplyr::count(ano_criacao, default_branch)  |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(y = n, x = ano_criacao, fill = default_branch)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y\", date_breaks = \"1 year\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Pastel1\") +\n  labs(x = \"Ano de criação\", y = \"Número de repositórios\", fill = \"Nome da Branch\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÉ possível ver que em 2021 o uso do termo ‘main’ para nomear as branches principais foi muito mais usado!

Os participantes escolhiam uma issue para trabalhar durante o evento, até a realização de um pull request. Em outra parede, os post-its estavam separados em: post-its de pull requests para serem avaliados pelo Hadley Wickham e outros contribuidores, e os post-its que já tinham sido avaliados e aceitos!\nOutra coisa legal é que o espaço disponibilizou diversas mesas agrupadas, o que ajudava a trabalhar em conjunto.\n\nLegenda: Foto tirada no tidy-dev-day, por @Dale_Masch.\nPara quem estava participando pela primeira vez eram recomendadas as issues de documentação, pois elas são mais naturais para quem nunca fez esse tipo de atividade antes. Para as pessoas que já tinham mais familiaridade eram recomendadas issues de bug ou feature que já exigem um conhecimento maior não só do pacote, mas também de como desenvolver a melhoria."

    "text": "Experiência pessoal - Bea\nEu nunca desenvovi um pacote, e ao chegar no evento nem sabia como pacotes eram estruturados. Na issue que eu escolhi, o objetivo era para melhorar uma mensagem de erro da função filter(), do pacote dplyr, para que a mensagem estivesse de acordo com o style guide do tidyverse. \nLegenda: Foto da issue que estava trabalhando, e também da moeda especial que recebemos, por @Bea_Milz.\nInicialmente, eu fiz o fork do repositório do dplyr, o clone no meu computador, e fiquei sem saber o que fazer depois. Eu não sabia em qual diretório ficavam as funções, estava com receio de alterar algo e causar algum erro em outras funções do pacote… Mas ainda bem que tive ajuda! A Ildi Czeller me mostrou em qual diretório as funções estavam (aliás, é no /R), e e então consegui encontrar o arquivo que precisava alterar, e qual parte do código era correspondente à função filter(). Uma coisa que conheci no evento e foi muito interessante é o conceito de testes, pois tive que alterar o teste referente à mensagem de erro que eu estava trabalhando.\nApós fazer as alterações que entendi que eram necessárias, fiz um pull request. O Hadley respondeu que outra pessoa também estava trabalhando neste tópico (haviam duas issues criadas para o mesmo problema), e indicou onde a pessoa estava sentada. Então fui lá e perguntei para o Colin (que estava trabalhando nesse mesmo problema) se poderíamos trabalhar na issue juntos. Ele foi super receptivo! Ele explicou como ele estava resolvendo, e eu também mostrei o que havia feito. O Hadley pediu para mudar uma função usada no teste, e ficamos trabalhando nisso juntos (no caso, eu estava mais aprendendo e perguntando para o Colin, pois os testes eram novidade para mim).\n\nLegenda: O pull request foi aceito!\nFoi uma experiência única, e aprendi muito nesse dia!"

Contei com a ajuda da Ildi Czeller que era uma das monitoras e me auxiliou em todas as etapas, dando dicas desde configurações no git até ensinando atalhos no Rstudio que facilitaram a vida (estão documentados aqui).\n\nLegenda: Criando um pull request no pacote ggplot2.\nA atividade promoveu o engajamento e contribuição de todos, desde de quem era novato até quem já tinha bastante experiência. Era um espaço aberto para tirar dúvidas e pedir ajuda, em um determinado momento pude conversar com o Hadley e tirar dúvida sobre uma issue que eu estava trabalhando. Entender melhor qual era a interpretação de melhoria daquele ponto com um dos autores do pacote foi um aprendizado incrível."

    "text": "No último final de semana, utilizei algumas horas para reformular essa página. Eu utilizava o tema Academic, porém queria algo mais simples, então mudei para o Lithium. Além disso, também habilitei os comentários com o Disqus, habilitei o Google Analytics e também resolvi testar o Netlify (que aliás achei incrível).\nDurante esse processo, algumas dificuldades apareceram… Também lembrei da primeira vez que criei uma página com o blogdown, onde graças à muitos conteúdos online eu consegui colocar no ar depois de várias mensagens de erro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOs conteúdos online, que muitas pessoas disponibilizaram através de posts em blog, livros, documentação, dúvidas no Stackoverflow, me ajudaram muito a conseguir entender como funcionava o processo de criar uma página com o blogdown. Esses conteúdos foram essenciais também para entender como deixar esse site disponível online utilizando o Github (lembrando que a minha formação é em Gestão Ambiental). Porém a maior parte desse conteúdo estava disponibilizado em inglês: foram poucos os materiais que encontrei em português.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLembrei também da conversa que tive rapidamente no mês passado com a Julia, co-organizadora do R-Ladies Niterói, onde disse que seria interessante que ela disponibilizasse online as palestras que ela já fez, para que outras pessoas consigam consultar e aprender com o conteúdo.\nSe você está em dúvida se deve compartilhar conteúdo na internet, eu indico a palestra (em inglês) do David Robinson na rstudio::conf 2019, chamada “The unreasonable effectiveness of public work”.\nAs formas de compartilhar conteúdo apontadas por David são: escrever um post em um blog, escrever um tweet, contribuir com projetos open source, dar palestras, gravar a tela enquanto faz alguma análise de dados e disponibilizar o vídeo, e escrever um livro sobre o assunto.\nNessa palestra, David diz que se você der a mesma dica/conselho três vezes, escreva um post em um blog, assim muitas pessoas conseguem acessar esse conteúdo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPor isso, pretendo fazer alguns posts em português com algumas dicas sobre como compartilhar conteúdo na internet, utilizando R. Não é segredo que eu sou fã dos pacotes criados pelo Yihui Xie, então os temas que pretendo abordar são:\n\nCriar seu currículo com R, usando o pacote pagedown;\nCriar uma página/blog com R, usando o pacote blogdown.\nCriar apresentações com R, usando o pacote xaringan - lembrando que existe uma apresentação sobre esse assunto disponível aqui. O Bruno Lucian se interessou em compartilhar esse conteúdo no blog Dados Aleatórios, então quando estiver disponível eu colocarei o link para o post aqui também.\n\n\n\n\nPara o compartilhar conteúdo, é interessante também utilizar git e Github. Mas considerando que nesse tema já existe bastante conteúdo em português, por enquanto vou focar nas ferramentas com R, que tem menos conteúdo disponível nessa língua.\nO post do William Oliveira, chamado Plano para estudar Git e GitHub enquanto aprende programação, me ajudou bastante a entender como começar a usar o git. Nesse post ele utiliza o terminal, e para algumas pessoas que estão iniciando essa abordagem pode ser um pouco intimidadora.\nOutra opção para quem está iniciando é utilizar o Github Desktop. Acredito que é uma interface amigável para quem está aprendendo como funciona o git.\n\n\n\nPretendo postar sobre esses conteúdos logo logo. Enquanto isso, estou aberta à sugestões. Existem outras formas que vocês usam para divulgar conteúdo utilizando R? Existe alguma que você conheça e gostaria de aprender mais? Existem dificuldades? Se sim, quais?"

    "text": "Como surgiu o interesse em aprender R?\nMeu nome é Beatriz, e a minha graduação foi em Gestão Ambiental. Porém, quando estava no mestrado, precisava utilizar a linguagem R para realizar análises estatísticas com os dados que coletei. Nunca me imaginei aprendendo a programar, e até tentei utilizar sozinha o R em 2017 (sem o RStudio), mas tive muita dificuldade. Então outra pessoa me ajudou com essas análises.\nDepois que conclui o mestrado, no segundo semestre de 2018, passei alguns meses me preparando e participando do processo seletivo do doutorado, e pensei que seria uma boa época para tentar aprender a “mexer com o R”. Eu queria conseguir fazer minhas próprias análises estatísticas sozinha! Perguntei para uma amiga, a Ana Lu, e ela me deu algumas dicas."

Eu sabia tão pouco, e me senti em um ambiente super seguro e confortável para fazer as perguntas que tinha.O R-Ladies desde o começo foi um grupo onde me sentia confortável, segura, e havia uma troca muito grande de conhecimento. Considero que muito do que já aprendi sobre R eu quero agradecer à comunidade R-Ladies e todas as participantes do grupo de São Paulo. Então desde outubro de 2018 venho auxiliado na organização dos encontros, o que tem sido uma experiência super interessante, além de ser uma forma de retribuir o que eu tenho recebido!"

Agradeço também a Maria pela companhia! Neste curso, além de aprender bastante e fazer miillllll perguntass (e agradeço os professores por também oferecerem um ambiente onde me sentisse confortável de perguntar tudo tudo tudo que tinha dúvida ou curiosidade), eu também saí de lá super empolgada em aprender mais sobre R.\nAtualmente estou me dedicando em realizar cursos online, pois em novembro fui contemplada com 3 meses de acesso através de uma bolsa de estudos para mulheres e minorias de gênero."

Agradeço a organização deste evento por oferecer um conteúdo tão legal e gratuito!\nEm novembro também fui contemplada com uma bolsa para jovens comunicadores e tive a oportunidade de participar do evento Coda BR. Eu fiquei tão feliz de poder participar deste evento, que mal tenho palavras para explicar como foi especial. Apesar de ter assistido conteúdo sobre R, o CODA BR foi muito além de programação: conheci mais sobre jornalismo de dados, tive a oportunidade de assistir palestras de especialistas nacionais e internacionais, conhecer pessoas que já admirava (a emoção de conhecer o Turicas, que eu admirava e conhecia através de podcasts e do trabalho no Brasil.IO), e principalmente conhecer muitas pessoas interessantes que depois se tornaram muito queridas para mim e que também fazem parte desta jornada."

Parecia uma ótima forma de comunicar os dados interativamente, com as pessoas que não necessariamente conhecem o R. Então no começo do ano de 2019 coloquei como meta: gostaria de começar a aprender como usar esse pacote.\nNo evento IV SER - IV Internacional Seminar on Statistics with R tive a oportunidade de assistir um workshop sobre shiny, oferecido pelo Dean Attali, que é consultor Shiny e uma referência no tema! Foi um ótimo workshop e fiquei bem feliz de conseguir acompanhar os exercícios.\nQuando voltei do evento, não queria parar de estudar e praticar o que comecei a aprender. Então recebi um email da Curso-R comunicando que havia turma aberta para o curso de Dashboards com R. Eu já havia participado de dois cursos da Curso-R (Introdução à programação em R e Webscrapping em R), e sabia que os cursos oferecidos eram muito bons. Então fiz a inscrição, e no mês de junho foram três sábados de estudos e bastante prática com Shiny! Recomendo muito o curso, os professores são muito bons."

Todos os códigos estão disponíveis neste repositório no Github.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplo de uso - Página para Pesquisa de Periódicos\nOs dados foram obtidos no website da CAPES. A página permite o download de uma tabela contendo o ISSN, título do periódico, área de avaliação e a nota na respectiva área. Utilizei os dados da avaliação mais recente disponível em junho/2019: 2013-2016.\nA IDE que utilizei foi o RStudio, e os pacotes que usados foram:\n\nshiny - usado para criar a plataforma interativa;\nshinydashboard - permite fazer dashboards com o shiny. Com a ajuda de CSS, consegui personalizar as cores do meu dashboard;\nshinyWidgets - oferece inputs diferentes, utilizei o sliderTextInput().\nDT - esse pacote permite usar tabelas no R utilizando a biblioteca JavaScript DataTables.\ntidyverse - readr, dplyr, purrr e stringr - usei os pacotes que fazem parte do tidyverse em diversas etapas do processo, como ler a base de dados, filtrar, manipular, alterar, entre outros;\njanitor - usei a função janitor::clean_names() , que permite alterar nome de todas as colunas da base de dados, deixando-as no padrão snake_case.\n\nO deploy foi feito gratuitamente no shinyapps.io, diretamente do RStudio!\nA maior dificuldade que tive com esse dashboard foi o filtro que gera a tabela. Inicialmente, ele não resultava o que eu precisava… eu fiquei cerca de duas semanas com esse problema, até que levei para os professores da Curso-R na última aula. Agradeço imensamente ao Julio Trecenti e ao William Amorim, que solucionaram o problema! Sem a ajuda que recebi, esse Shiny App ainda estaria apenas no meu computador…\nPor outro lado, é muito gratificante ver tudo funcionando, ter ideias e conseguir implementá-las! Mostrei para algumas pessoas, que deram feedbacks sobre as dificuldades que tiveram ao utilizar a página. Isso foi muito importante também para aprimorar o Shiny App."

Já tenho uma ideia para um próximo Shiny App, agora o que falta é ter tempo para isso.
