You can read more about me in the about page, and check my presentations on the talks page.\nI think that some of the blog posts I write would be useful to a broader audience, so I wanted to start blogging in English (or translating blog posts that I wrote).\nMy blog in Portuguese was build using blogdown and Hugo Apéro, and I really like it. I searched if it was possible to adapt the blog that I had to a multi-language blog (so I could have posts in Portuguese, English and Spanish), but I had no success on my quest."

I was excited to test Quarto to create a blog sometime ago, but I really liked my blog with blogdown/Apéro.\nSo when I started thinking about writing blog posts in English, I thought that it would be a good idea to create a separate, brand new blog to store content in English, using Quarto.\nMy blog in Portuguese will continue to exist, and I will continue to post there (in Portuguese). In this blog, I’ll add content in English.\nNow that I explained why this blog was created, I’m going to write about some of the steps that you need to take to create a blog with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA lot of the steps that I explain in this post can be used to create other outputs with Quarto, such as websites, presentations, and books."

I have not found a lot of blogs made with Quarto, and I think because it is a new software. So, take a look at these blogs:\n\nNotes from a data witch: A data science blog by Danielle Navarro - Danielle is a data scientist and she has an awesome blog made with Quarto.

GitHub? (Click to expand!)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have not used Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE before, I recommend you to take some time to prepare your environment and configure everything before continuing reading this post.\nYou can read detailed information about how to do this in the book Happy Git with R.\nHere is a useful check-list you can use:\n\n\nInstall Git on your computer\n\nCreate a free account on GitHub\n\nInstall package usethis: install.packages(\"usethis\")\n\nIntroduce yourself to Git:\n\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # your name\n  user.name = \"Captain Marvel\",\n  # your email used in your GitHub account\n  user.email = \"awesomecaptain@gmail.com\"\n)\n\n\n\nCreate a GitHub PAT Token with usethis::create_github_token() (is like a password)\n\nStore your token with gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nRestart your R Session (usually CTRL + SHIFT + F10 will do the work)\n\nUse usethis::git_sitrep() to check if your name, email and PAT are configured. The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

If it is not there, I recommend restarting RStudio and opening your project again.\nThen, in your Git Pane, the list of files with changes will appear. Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog! People need to log in with GitHub in order to write a comment or give a reaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen we activate the comments, as default they appear in almost every page! You can hide the comments in specific pages by adding comments: false in the YAML headers of *.qmd files that you want to hide."

You can check how I configured this in this file.\nWrite about yourself, so people can get to know you. You can do that in the about.qmd file. There, you can add links to your social media, a photo, and other information about you that you think might be relevant. You can change the template of this page, in the template option. You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot. I enjoy reading blog posts that people write about topics they are interested in!"

The most important thing to look for is: Personal access token for 'https://github.com': '<discovered>'.\n\nIf it is all configured, you are ready to continue reading this post. 🚀\n\n\n\nIf you already configure Git and GitHub with RStudio IDE, you can use these two functions from the usethis package, in the project that you created:\n\nuse_git() to start the version control of your project (the function will ask you if you want to commit your changes and restart RStudio, you can accept it):\n\n\nusethis::use_git()\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/Desktop/name-of-your-blog/'\n# ✔ Initialising Git repo\n# ✔ Adding '.Rproj.user', '.Rhistory', '.Rdata', '.httr-oauth', '.DS_Store' to '.gitignore'\n# There are 8 uncommitted files:\n# * '_quarto.yml'\n# * '.gitignore'\n# * 'about.qmd'\n# * 'example-quarto-blog.Rproj'\n# * 'index.qmd'\n# * 'posts/'\n# * 'profile.jpg'\n# * 'styles.css'\n\n\n# Is it ok to commit them?\n# \n# 1: Not now\n# 2: Yup\n# 3: Negative\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\n# ✔ Adding files\n# ✔ Making a commit with message 'Initial commit'\n# • A restart of RStudio is required to activate the Git pane\n# Restart now?\n# \n# 1: No way\n# 2: Definitely\n# 3: No\n# \n# Selection: 2\n\n\nuse_github() to create a GitHub repository to store your code, and a new window will open with your repository:\n\n\nusethis::use_github()\n# ℹ Defaulting to 'https' Git protocol\n# ✔ Setting active project to '/Users/beatrizmilz/Desktop/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Creating GitHub repository 'beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n# ✔ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog.git'\n# ✔ Pushing 'main' branch to GitHub and setting 'origin/main' as upstream branch\n# ✔ Opening URL 'https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the repository used in this example: https://github.com/beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog"

This step is called deploy, and we will use a service called Netlify for this purpose.\n\nFirst, Sign up or Log in on Netlify. I recommend signing in using your GitHub account.\nThen, you can click Add new site and Import an existing project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, you need to connect to a Git provider. In this case, click the link to GitHub. It may ask you to authenticate with GitHub if you have not done this already.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, in Pick a repository from GitHub, choose the repository that you created for your blog:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis step is really important, so don’t hurry up and take your time to do it with care! In Import an existing project from a Git repository, you only have to change one thing: the Base directory field. You need to write the name of the directory used to store the HTML files of your blog. By default, it is _site. This is because when you generate your blog, by default Quarto saves all the HTML files generated for your site in the directory called _site. Everything else will be filled out by Netlify, so don’t change anything else. Check if everything looks like the image below and then click Deploy site:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first deploy a website on Netlify, it will show an automatic URL. In this case it was peppy-cat-2e067c.netlify.app. You can change it to a more personal URL, which would be easier for other people to type and remember. To change your site URL, click Site settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen click Change site name:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd choose the name used for the URL of your blog, writing it on the field Site name. Below this field, you can see how the URL of your blog is going to look like! After choosing it, click Save. If you need, you can change it after.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the blog that I am creating as an example is available in this link: https://your-awesome-blog-with-quarto.netlify.app/"

Check the boxes of the files that you want to update, and click Commit:\n Next, you need to write a message that, in a few words, explains what was changed. Write this message in the Commit message field, and the click Commit:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, close the Git window, then click Push (it is the green up-arrow button on the Git pane).\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all the changes are sent to GitHub, the Git Pane will be empty, meaning that there are no new changes:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, wait a minute and then check your blog online!"

You can use whatever suits you best.\nI chose to use Giscus and here I’ll tell you how to set it up!\n\nYour repository needs to be public on GitHub. The default is to be public, it will only be private if you changed it (you can change it back on your repository settings on GitHub).\nInstall the Giscus App. Go to this website and click the Install button:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Giscus will ask you in which repositories you would like to give permission to Giscus. You can choose what you prefer. I chose to give access only to the repository that I’m going to need this service, so I chose Only select repository and pick the repository of the blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have to enable the Discussions in your repository. First, go to your repository, and click Settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, scroll down to the Features sections, and check the box of the Discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the _quarto.yml file and add this code. Remember to update the information of your repo: in this example is beatrizmilz/name-of-your-blog because beatrizmilz is my GitHub account, and name-of-your-blog is the repository of this example blog.\n\n\ncomments:\n  giscus:\n    repo: YOURGITHUBACCOUNT/YOURREPO\n\nRemember to commit all the changes before checking the online version! If you missed that, go back to the end of section 7 and read the collapsed tip.\nNow we have a comments section on the blog!

You can check all the templates in the Quarto documentation. In this personal blog, I chose to use trestles.\nWrite blog posts! Your blog posts are stored in the posts/ directory. Each post has to have a folder, and inside this folder you need a index.qmd file. But follow along the template that is already there and you will be good to go. Also, I recommend checking the awesome options described on the Quarto documentation.\nIf you are out of ideas about what to write, my advice is to write something that you already know, want to learn, or something that you like a lot.

So I let it go, until I saw a post on Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about the training and certification that she took.\nI got in touch with her (who I had met in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nFor this study group, we created a Slack channel, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams, and to feel confident in taking them."

A participação do Daniel possibilitou que eu realizasse a apresentação da prova didática totalmente em Português, além de poder responder as perguntas da prova em Português também. Quero deixar registrado aqui o meu agradecimento para o Greg Wilson por apresentar essa possibilidade, e também ao Daniel Falbel por aceitar acompanhar esse processo!

Não sei se a RStudio tem planos de aplicar o treinamento em outros idiomas (como a The Carpentries, onde já existe alguns oferecimentos de treinamentos em Espanhol).\nAs provas que eu realizei foram aplicadas pelo Greg Wilson e acompanhadas pelo brasileiro Daniel Falbel (que trabalha na RStudio no desenvolvimento do Torch for R, e também é um dos sócios fundadores da Curso-R). A participação do Daniel possibilitou que eu realizasse a apresentação da prova didática totalmente em Português, além de poder responder as perguntas da prova em Português também. Quero deixar registrado aqui o meu agradecimento para o Greg Wilson por apresentar essa possibilidade, e também ao Daniel Falbel por aceitar acompanhar esse processo! Foi muito importante para me sentir mais tranquila na prova, já que teria que me preocupar menos com o idioma e mais com o conteúdo das provas em si."

All the necessary information is available on this site, but I will add some extra links here as well!\n\nImportant: I did the entire training process with Greg Wilson, however he is no longer involved with it. So I don’t know if any of the steps have changed. Here I will describe what the process was when I did the training."

    "text": "The importance of the R community\nFirst of all: I would like to point out that the R community was essential for me to be able to take this training.\nWhen I found out about the existence of this certification, I soon came across a difficulty to participate: on the website it said that it was necessary to pay (in dollars) to do the training.\nFor those who are Brazilians, we know how the local currency is very devalued, and this ends up making it difficult for many Brazilian people to participate. So I let it go, until I saw a post on Yanina Saibene’s blog talking about the training and certification that she took.\nI got in touch with her (who I had met in person at LatinR 2019) to find out more about what the training was like for her. She put me in touch with a group of people who are part of several chapters of R-Ladies in Latin America, who were starting to organize a study group (and support!) to do the training. In addition, she also gave me more information on how to make this financially possible.\nFor this study group, we created a Slack channel, where we shared tips, exercise resolutions and questions. In addition, we had weekly Zoom meetings to discuss chapters from the book R for Data Science (also available in Spanish this link).\nThe guidance from Yanina Saibene and the support from the study group were essential for me to prepare for the exams, and to feel confident in taking them."

    "text": "Provas de certificação\nApós realizar o treinamento, a próxima etapa foi realizar a prova de ensino, e a prova da certificação desejada (que, no meu caso, foi sobre tidyverse). Neste link é possível acessar um exemplo de provas, disponiblizado pela RStudio para estudo.\nNão existe ordem correta para realizar as provas! Outro ponto importante é que as provas foram feitas com a tela compartilhada, e foi permitido fazer qualquer tipo de pesquisa na internet. Porém a prova tem um limite de tempo, então é importante ficar atenta(o) ao tempo que usa pesquisando!\n\nProva de Ensino\nA prova de ensino foi composta por uma aula demonstrativa de 15 minutos, e algumas questões a serem respondidas (relacionadas à ensino).\nAntes da prova em si, foi necessário enviar alguns materiais solicitados para serem utilizados em uma aula demonstrativa. Os materiais que eu preparei estão disponibilizados nesta página: https://beatrizmilz.github.io/RStudio_Certification/ (e o código também está disponível neste repositório no GitHub.\nEu utilizei ferramentas como uma página onde o material é disponibilizado feita com o pacote distill (Allaire et al. 2021), a apresentação feita com o pacote xaringan (Xie 2022), dois exercícios para serem feitos ao final da aula utilizando o pacote learnr (Schloerke et al. 2021), a demonstração com código ao vivo foi realizada usando a IDE RStudio, e um mapa conceitual elaborado com a ferramenta CMap Tools. Porém essas são as ferramentas que eu escolhi utilizar, e eu recomendo que você utilize o que estiver mais confortável para você! A única ferramenta que é obrigatória a ser utilizada nessa etapa é a IDE RStudio (o que é fácil de entender o motivo…).\n\n\nProva sobre tidyverse\nA prova de tidyverse consistiu em resolver diversos exercícios usando R e tidyverse. A recomendação da RStudio para estudar para essa prova é a leitura do livro R for Data Science.\nNão tenho muito a falar desta etapa, apenas que pratique e use o quanto possível no seu dia-a-dia, assim você terá mais experiência e conseguirá resolver os problemas mais rapidamente durante a prova.\n\nQuero ainda escrever um post sobre algumas funções que não são tão comuns, mas que foram úteis para a prova! Assim que o post estiver disponível, editarei e adicionarei o link aqui."
